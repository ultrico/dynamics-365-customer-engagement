# Basic navigation in App for Outlook

Use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook while youâ€™re using Outlook on the desktop, web, or phone. When App for Outlook is installed you can use the Dynamics 365 pane to link and track Outlook emails and appointments to records in your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The latest release of Dynamics 365 App for Outlook works with customer engagement apps (such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](../../sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](../../customer-service/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Marketing](../../marketing/help-hub.yml). [Dynamics 365 Field Service](../../field-service/overview.md), and [Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation](/dynamics365/project-operations/psa/overview)), [Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), version 9](../../customerengagement/on-premises/overview.md), and [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).
> - For a prior release that works with earlier versions of Dynamics 365 apps, see [Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/administering-dynamics-365/dn946901(v=crm.8)). 


## Install 

Before installing App for Outlook, contact your administrator and make sure all the prerequisites are met. For more information, see [Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](../deploy-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook.md).

In most cases, your administrator will automatically push the app to you and it should be available in the Outlook ribbon. If you don't see it, then you can install it yourself. For more information, see [Have users install App for Outlook themselves](../deploy-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook.md#have-users-install-app-for-outlook-themselves).


## Access the app and sign in

Once installed it's easy to access the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane whether you're using Outlook on your desktop or the web app.

- In the Outlook desktop client, select **Dynamics 365**.

   > ![Open App for Outlook pane in Outlook Web Access.](../media/outlook-web-app.png)

When you first access the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook pane, you are prompted to sign in to your Dynamics 365 account. In the confirmation message, select **Allow** and then follow the steps on screen to sign in to Dynamics 365. After you have signed in, as long as you use the app frequently, you'll remain signed in. If you haven't used the app for 90 days, you will be asked to sign in again. 

   
## Pin 

If you're using the Outlook desktop client or Outlook Web Access, you can pin App for Outlook so that it remains open when you navigate from one email to another. If you don't see the pin option, then verify that it's supported for your setup. For more information, see [What's supported](support-matrix.md).

- To pin the app, select the pin. To unpin, select the pin again.
