# Provide consent to collect data from Microsoft 365  

Dynamics 365 Sales uses Microsoft 365 data to generate the following insights based on users' email interactions and meetings:

- [Relationship analytics KPIs and health score](relationship-analytics.md)
- [Who knows whom suggestions](who-knows-whom.md)

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium and Microsoft 365 <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Global administrator in Microsoft 365 <br> |


## Things to consider

Before you provide consent, review the following information:

- Both relationship analytics and who knows whom require the same consent. You only need to consent once. For more information about the different consent types, see [Consent required to use Microsoft 365 data](ms365-consent-types.md).

- The consent applies to all the Dynamics 365 applications that require permission to access Microsoft 365 data.

- When consent is provided, Dynamics 365 analyzes Exchange emails pertaining to the last one year to provide relationship insights and who knows whom suggestions. The analysis is done in 12 batches, with each batch containing emails from one month. Dynamics 365 can handle up to 8 million emails per batch in this process. The live data is then processed after every 24 hours.

- After you provide consent, all Dynamics 365 users in the tenant are automatically opted in to share their data. To opt out, do one of the following: 
    - Inform users to [turn off data sharing](who-knows-whom.md#turn-off-data-sharing-with-dynamics-365-applications) if they don't want to share their data.  
    - [Enable relationship intelligence](enable-ri.md#enable-relationship-intelligence) for specific security roles and add users to one of the security roles to collect only their data.

- The following data is collected from Exchange:
    Email ID, Date, and so on.
- The who knows whom insights are visible only to the Salesperson and Sales Manager security roles by default. The Dynamics 365 administrator can [grant access](grant-access-wkw.md) to other roles if required.  

- When you withdraw consent, the system can take up to 24 hours to remove data from all apps and up to 30 days to remove backed-up data from Microsoft 365 storage accounts. After you withdraw consent, users will be automatically opted out.  


## Provide consent  

1. In **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Settings** > **Org settings** > **Dynamics 365 Applications**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/office365-consent-form.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Microsoft 365 admin center Org settings, with the Dynamics 365 Apps consent form shown.":::
    
3. Select **Identifiable insights for other users**.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The consent applies to all the Dynamics 365 applications that require the **Identifiable insights for other users** permission. Dynamics 365 Sales uses this consent for both relationship analytics and who knows whom.
    
1. (Optional) In the textbox that appears, enter the security group IDs of users who want to opt out of sharing their Exchange data. For example, opt out groups such as C-suite, M&A, finance, and so on.
    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-opt-out.PNG" alt-text="A screenshot of the opt out textbox to provide security IDs":::
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The opt out is only applicable for future data collections. Existing data of users in the security group will remain in the system. Let's suppose Amber moved from the Sales team to the M&A team, which is opted out by the admin. In this case, Amber's data before the move will be available in the system but not after she joins the M&A security group.  

1. Save the changes.
    The user opt-in is automatically turned on for all tenant users unless they've manually [turned off data sharing](who-knows-whom.md#turn-off-data-sharing-with-dynamics-365-applications).
