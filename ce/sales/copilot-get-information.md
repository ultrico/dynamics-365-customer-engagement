Work with your Dynamics 365 Sales administrator to [add those fields to the configuration](copilot-configure-summary-fields.md).

Keep in mind that the summary fields are configured at the organization level. Make sure that your entire sales team agrees on the **top 10** fields that are most relevant for your business.

### Enrich leads with related information

Copilot can enrich your leads with information from Dynamics 365 Sales, LinkedIn, and Bing, such as:

- Possible contacts, based on the lead name, phone number, email address, and company name

- The latest news about the account, curated by Bing

- Suggested LinkedIn profiles for the contact, if you have the LinkedIn Sales Navigator license

After you select a lead, Copilot suggests other records that might be associated with the lead and from which it can glean more information.

1. [Ask Copilot to summarize a lead](#summarize-a-lead).

    If Copilot finds possible matching contact records, it lists them after the summary. [How does Copilot match leads with contacts and can I customize the matching fields?](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-does-copilot-match-leads-with-contacts-and-can-i-customize-the-matching-fields)

1. Select **Connect** to connect the lead with a matching record.
