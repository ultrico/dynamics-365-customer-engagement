## Create a discount list

Motivate customers to buy more by offering them discounts on bulk purchases. To offer discounts, you need to set up a discount list.

    ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") in the lower-left corner and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **Product Catalog**, select **Discount Lists**.

    > ![Unit groups in site map.](media/site-map-unit-group.png "Unit groups in site map")


4.	To create a new discount list, on the command bar, select **New**.

    -OR-
  
    To edit a discount list, open a discount list from the list.

5.	Fill in the information, and select **Save**:

    a.	**Name**. Type a name that provides a good description of the kind of discount this list will include.

    b.	**Type**. To calculate the discount as a percentage of the price of the item, select Percentage or to give discount as a fixed amount, select Amount.

    c.	**Currency**. If you chose to give discount as a fixed amount, select the currency.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Discount list form.](media/discount-list-form.png "Discount list form")
 
6.	To add discount details to the list, select the **Related** tab, and then select **Discounts**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Discount tab on the Discount List form.](media/discount-list-form-related-tab-discounts-option.png "Discount tab on the Discount List form")
 
7.	On the **Discounts** tab, select **New Discount**.

8.	In the **New Discount** form, fill in the following information, and select **Save & Close**:

    a.	**Begin quantity**. Enter the minimum quantity a customer should purchase to be eligible for the discount.  

    b.	**End quantity**. Enter the maximum quantity for which the discount is applicable.  

    c.	**Percentage** or **Amount**. Enter the percentage or the amount of discount the customer will receive.

    For example, this discount list will offer a discount of $5 whenever the customer purchases between 2 – 5 pieces of televisions.
