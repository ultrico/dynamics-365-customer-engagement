# Configure predictive opportunity scoring

Predictive opportunity scoring uses a predictive machine learning model to calculate a score for open opportunities based on historical data. The score helps sellers prioritize opportunities and achieve higher opportunity won rates, and reduces the time it takes to win an opportunity.

For example, say you have two opportunities, Opportunity A and Opportunity B, in your pipeline. The opportunity scoring model calculates a score of 80 for Opportunity A and 50 for Opportunity B. Based on the scores, you can predict that Opportunity A has a greater chance of being converted into a won deal. Further, you can review the top influencing factors to analyze why Opportunity B's score is low and decide whether to improve it.

The following image shows an example of an opportunity scoring widget:

Historical data collection begins when you create a scoring model. Historical data is stored in the data lake for analysis. If your Dynamics 365 Sales subscription expires or your org is deleted, the historical data is deleted after 30 days.

If you have a Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, you can enable predictive opportunity scoring in [lead and opportunity scoring quick setup](digital-selling-scoring.md#set-up-lead-and-opportunity-scoring). You'll get 1,500 scored records per month.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator<br>More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md) |

## Prerequisites

- [Advanced Sales Insights features must be enabled](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#enable-and-configure-premium-sales-insights-features).


- You need to have enough opportunities to train the model based on past data. Your organization must have created and closed at least 40 won and 40 lost opportunities during the time frame selected in the **Train with opportunities from the past** field of the scoring model. The time frame ranges from three months to two years. [Verify whether you have the required number of leads to build a scoring model](faq-lead.md#scoring-minimum-requirement).
- To define a [per stage model](#what-is-a-per-stage-model), you must have at least 40 closed opportunities in the last stage of the business process in the selected time frame. The more opportunities you can include to train the model, the better the prediction results will be. [Verify whether you have the required number of opportunities to build a per stage scoring model](faq-opportunity.md#opportunity-per-stage-scoring).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're planning to use a business process flow for your model, then opportunities that have abandoned the selected business process flow will not be considered for training, scoring, and for establishing the minimum requirement for model creation.

The system takes about four hours to sync the data with the data lake. If you've closed opportunities recently, the model won't consider them right away.

## What is a per stage model?

A per stage model calculates the influence of attributes at each stage of the business process flow based on past data. For example, you can review how the estimated close date influences different stages of the opportunity. You can then decide which stages are relevant for each attribute, according to your organization's standards, and improve the model's accuracy.

Per stage modeling is disabled by default. You can enable it only when you're [adding a scoring model](#add-a-model).

When per stage modeling is disabled, the model uses only attributes that had a higher influence on opportunities that were closed as won. For example, if most of the won deals had an associated business phone number, the model may give a higher score to opportunities that have an associated business phone number.

## Create your first scoring model

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If you're using a model that you created in a version of Dynamics 365 earlier than 2020 release wave 2, [delete the model](pls-duplicate-models.md#delete-a-model) before you create a new one. Otherwise, the previous version of the model will be applied to all opportunities in your organization, and new models won't have any effect on the opportunities.
> - As of 2020 release wave 2, the application writes the opportunity scoring data to the [**msdyn_predictivescore**](developer/entities/msdyn_predictivescore.md) table and no longer writes to the opportunity entity. Both lead and opportunity scoring use the **msdyn_predictivescore** table.

A scoring model defines the criteria for choosing opportunities for training and scoring. If your organization follows different sales practices across different regions or business units, you can create models and unique training sets for each of them.

1. Go to **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the Sales Hub app, and select **Sales Insights settings**.

1. On the site map under **Predictive models**, select **Opportunity scoring**.
  
   If your organization doesn't have at least 40 won and 40 lost opportunities that were created in the time frame identified in the **Train with opportunities from the past** field, you can't create a scoring model. If there are enough opportunities, the app generates a model by default.

1. On the **Predictive opportunity scoring** page, change the values for fields such as business process flow, filter column, and so on if needed. For more information about these fields, see the next section [Add a model](#add-a-model). When you're done, select **Get started**.

Allow some time for the app to train your model. You can leave the page and come back later.

The application uses standard attributes to train the model. You can [edit the model](pls-edit-and-retrain-model.md) later to include custom or intelligent attributes.

## Publish your model

1. When your model is trained and ready to publish, the **Predictive opportunity scoring** page displays a confirmation:

    :::image type="content" source="media/pos-model-ready.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation message that appears after a scoring model is trained and ready to publish.":::

2. If the model is trained but not ready to publish, the **Model performance** field displays **Not ready to Publish**.

1. To retrain the model every 15 days, select **Retrain automatically**.

1. Select **Publish** or **View details**.

    - If the model is ready to publish and you're ready to apply it, select **Publish**.

        The model is applied to opportunities that match the criteria specified in the model configuration. The opportunity score appears in the **Opportunity score** column in views and in a widget in the opportunity form.

    - To [view the model's accuracy and performance](scoring-model-accuracy.md) before you publish it, or if the model isn't ready to publish and you want to know why, select **View Details**, and then select the **Performance** tab.

        The app determines that the model isn't ready to publish if its accuracy falls below a threshold value, the **Area under curve (AUC) score**. You can still publish the model if you like. However, it will perform poorly.


## Add a model

You can create up to 10 models, both published and unpublished, for different sets of opportunities. The app warns you if you try to create a model that might score the same opportunities as an existing model.

1. At the bottom of the **Predictive opportunity scoring** page, select **Add model**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pls-add-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add model option.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You won't see the **Add model** button if you haven't created at least one scoring model.

    The **Predictive opportunity scoring** page opens with default values.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pos-new-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a new scoring model.":::

1. In the **New model name** box, enter a name that contains alphanumeric characters. Underscores are allowed, but not spaces or other special characters.

     By default, the name is **OpportunityScoring_**<***YYYYMMDD***><***Time***> (for example, **OpportunityScoring_202009181410**). The date and time are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

1. In the **Business process flow** list, select a flow that's relevant for the opportunities that you're generating the model for. Opportunities that have abandoned the selected business process flow will not be considered for training, scoring, and for establishing the minimum requirement for model creation.

    The list displays all the business process flows that are defined for opportunities in your organization. If you want to enable per stage modeling, you must select a business process flow.

    To display custom business process flows in the list, [enable **Change Tracking**](/power-platform/admin/enable-change-tracking-control-data-synchronization) for the business process flow entity. When you generate the model, custom business processes are automatically enabled to sync the data to the data lake for analysis.

1. In the **State option set** list, select the option set in which the status of the opportunities is defined.

1. Select the corresponding values in the **Won Value** and **Lost Value** lists, respectively.

    The out-of-the-box **Status** state option set defines the values as **Won** and **Lost**. You can select a custom option set if one is defined.

1. Select **Filter column** and **Filter values** to specify the opportunities that the model must score.

    To filter based on multiple columns, [create a calculated field](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/define-calculated-fields) with the required columns, and then select the calculated field in the **Filter column** list.

1. In the **Train with opportunities from the past** list, select a time period for the training set. The default is two years.

    Your organization must have a minimum of 40 won and 40 lost opportunities that were created and closed during the selected period. The model analyzes closed opportunities from the selected period and uses that data to score open opportunities from the past two years.

    If you don't have the minimum closed opportunities in the chosen time period, the **Get started** button is disabled. Select another time period that has enough closed opportunities to train the model.

1. (Optional) Enable **Per stage modeling** to select the attributes that the model must consider for each business process stage.

    After creating the model, you'll be able to view the prediction influence of each attribute across different stages. You can then select the attributes and corresponding stages.


    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enable **Per stage modeling**, be sure to select a business process in the **Business process flow** list.

1. Select **Get started**. You'll get a warning message if the model is a duplicate of an existing model and is scoring the same set of opportunities. You can choose to create the model anyway or change the configurations to let the model score unique set of opportunities.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pls-conflicting-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the warning that's displayed when a new model conflicts with an existing one":::

    The system will take a few minutes to train your model.

1. When your model is trained, [publish it or view its details](#publish-your-model).
