# Edit assignment rules

To modify your process for automatically assigning leads, opportunities, or insights to sellers, you can update the conditions that you've defined in the rule.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | [Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/), or [Microsoft Relationship Sales](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-in/sales/relationship-sales/) |

## Edit an assignment rule

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app.

1. In the lower-left corner of the page, select **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.

1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Work assignment**.

1. Select a **Record type** to view segments of that type.

1. Open a segment, and then select the **Assignment rules** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Assignment rules** tab, select the link in the **Assignment rules** column.
