# Predefined security roles for Sales

Predefined security roles define permissions and access levels specific to different sales personas. [Assign users to appropriate security roles](#assign-security-roles-to-users) to grant them adequate access to the system.

## Predefined security roles

Security roles control users' access to data through a set of access levels and permissions. The combination of access levels and permissions that are included in a specific security role defines a user's access to data and their interactions with that data. For more information, go to [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

The predefined security roles for Dynamics 365 Sales include permissions and access levels that the default sales personas will need. For example, the Sales Manager and Salesperson security roles can be associated with those respective users in your organization. As a system administrator, you can verify the permissions and access levels granted for each role and modify them to suit your needs. For more information, go to [Create or edit a security role](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role). 

The predefined security roles are divided into the following categories:

- [Administration and customization roles](#administration-and-customization-roles)
- [Primary sales roles](#primary-sales-roles)
- [Functional roles](#functional-roles)
- [App access roles](#app-access-roles)
- [Internal roles](#internal-roles)

   corner, and select **Advanced Settings**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, you’ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

2. Select **Settings** in the Business Management interface, and
   go to **Security** under **System**.

3. Select **Users**, and then select the user account.

4. Select **Manage Roles**, and choose the roles that you want to assign to the user.
