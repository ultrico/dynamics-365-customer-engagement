## Types of command steps

The following command steps are available in sequences:  

- [Advance to another sequence](#advance-to-another-sequence)
- [Update field](#update-field)

## Advance to another sequence  

Transfers the sequence control from the current sequence to the selected sequence. For example, you defined a sequence **S1** and attached a sequence **S2** after an initial activity of sending an introduction email. When **S1** is attached to a record and seller completes the initial task of sending an introduction email, the record starts displaying the activities defined in **S2**. The following are the considerations to use this activity:  

- A sequence can't start with this activity
- Other steps can't be added after this activity

To add the advance to another sequence activity step:  

1. In the sequence designer page, select the **Add** (**+**) icon under a step.  
1. On the **Add an action or other element** dialog box, under the **Commands** tab, select **Advance to another sequence**.

1. In the **Advance to another sequence** pane, from the **Connect to** list, choose a sequence to attach. The list consists of the sequences that are active and related to the record type.  
    :::image type="content" source="media/sequence-activity-advance-to-another-sequence-created.png" alt-text="Screen shot of example for advance to another sequence activity.":::  
1. Close the **Advance to another sequence** pane.  
    The activity step is added to the sequence.
  
## Update field

Creates a step that automatically updates a record by using a configured value for a field. When the activity is displayed to the seller in the record, the field automatically gets updated with the value you configured. The following types of fields are supported (including custom fields):

- Two options (for example, a **Do Not Email** field that contains the values **Allow** and **Do Not Allow**).  
- Option set (for example, a **Budget** field that contains the values **No Committed Budget**, **May Buy**, **Can Buy**, and **Will Buy**).

You can add this activity anywhere in the sequence. As soon as the previous activity is completed, the **Update field** activity is executed automatically and the sequence moves on to the next activity. To avoid executing the **Update field** step immediately after the previous activity is completed, add the [Set wait time](steps-sequence.md#set-wait-time) activity (described earlier in this topic) before the **Update field** activity.  
Sellers can see the activity on the timeline of the record.  
To add the update field activity step:  

1. In the sequence designer page, select the **Add** (**+**) icon under a step.  
1. On the **Add an action or other element** dialog box, under the **Commands** tab, select **Update field**.  
    :::image type="content" source="media/sequence-activity-update-field.png" alt-text="Screen shot of update field activity.":::  
1. In the **Update field** pane, under **Automatically update this field**, select a field. Under **With this value**, select a value to use to update the record automatically.  
    :::image type="content" source="media/sequence-activity-update-field-created.png" alt-text="Screen shot of example of the update field activity.":::  
1. Close the **Update field** pane.  
    The activity step is added to the sequence.
