## View real-time analysis of call data
  
Before you start a call, choose the call language on the dialer.  


When a call is connected, the **Record** option appears. Turn on this option to get real-time analysis of the call.

You can perform the following actions during the call:  

- **Connect and edit the record**: On the **Details** tab, you can connect the record that's relevant to the call and edit it if required. You can also view the phone call activity.

-	**Take notes**: On the **Notes** tab, you can take meeting notes to summarize key points or any other important information about the call. The added notes are automatically saved to the activityâ€™s timeline, and are also available in the **Call summary** tab of the phone call activity. For more information about activities, see [Track and manage activities](manage-activities.md).

The defined keywords and competitors that were mentioned in the call are highlighted in bold text. More information: [Configure keywords and competitors](configure-keywords-competitors-sales-app.md)

After the call is ended, select **Full summary** to view the summary of the call. More information: [View and understand call summary](view-and-understand-call-summary-sales-app.md)
