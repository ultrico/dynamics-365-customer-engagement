# View and understand the call summary page

Sellers and their managers need an easy way to review their conversations with customers and quickly find talking points and insights. The call summary page provides that high-level view of how a conversation with a customer went. It includes action items and relevant keywords, a timeline, and a transcript of the call to help both sellers and managers.

- Sellers can quickly review past conversations with a customer and highlight important topics and commitments.
- Managers can get a high-level view of how their sales team is managing their relationships with customers.

If one or more opportunities are associated with the call, select the **Related opportunity** tab to view them. To add a related opportunity to the call, search for and select the opportunity.

## Understand the call summary page

The call summary page includes the following sections:

- [Overview, notes, action items, and highlights](#overview-notes-action-items-and-highlights)
- [Call transcript and translation](#call-transcript-and-translation)  
- [Call playback timeline and segmentation](#call-playback-timeline-and-segmentation)

### Overview, notes, action items, and highlights

This section is where you'll find key insights generated from conversation intelligence.

#### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab displays the following information about the conversation:

- The date, time, and length of the call
- Tags that were added to the conversation to improve searchability
- The names of the people who participated in the call
- KPIs for each person

  - For the seller: Talk to listen ratio, average talking speed, number of switches per conversation, and average pause length
  - For the customer: Length of the longest monologue

##### View categorization tag for short duration calls (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

Conversation intelligence can detect and tag short duration calls for the following categories:

- Voicemail
- Contact is unavailable
- Short calls with reschedule requests
- Short calls in which the contact indicates the call is unwanted

If the tag is inappropriate, you can delete it.  

Your administrator must [enable the **Call categorization (preview)**](fre-setup-ci-sales-app.md#enable-call-categorization-for-short-calls-preview) feature for the system to tag short duration calls. You can also view these tags in the [Conversation intelligence app](https://sales.ai.dynamics.com/) under **Seller Details** > **Call History** section. For more information, see [View a sellerâ€™s performance to identify best practices and coaching opportunities](conversation-intelligence-seller-details.md).  

#### Notes tab

The **Notes** tab helps reduce the time it takes you to summarize the call by offering intelligent suggestions, including action items, commitments, call minutes, and next steps. Writing a personalized summary of the call helps you to focus on the customer's need, quickly review key points, and understand the next course of action. You can share the summary with stakeholders through email.

### Call playback timeline and segmentation

Use the call playback feature to listen to the recorded call. To skip to a specific point, drag the progress bar or select a location in the playback. The call transcript automatically scrolls to that moment in the call. You can also pause, rewind, and move forward through the call and adjust the volume. The playback timeline also displays the sentiments detected in the conversation, positive, neutral, or negative.

:::image type="content" source="media/ci-summary-playback-sales-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the playback timeline on the call summary page.":::

When you go to the **Highlights** tab and hover over or select a keyword or other highlight, a diamond icon appears on the playback timeline to indicate the time that it was mentioned.

The timeline shows how the conversation was segmented and the topics that were discussed in a segment. You can choose a specific segment to drill down into relevant insights. The transcript adjusts to display the start of the segment and highlights the segment in the playback timeline. If the selected segment contains any action items or keywords, they're displayed on their respective tabs.
