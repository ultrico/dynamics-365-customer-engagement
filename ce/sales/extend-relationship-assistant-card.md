## What are actions or insight cards?

Action cards provide you up to date information on email, meeting, and more in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. These cards remind you of upcoming activities; it evaluates your communications, and suggests when it might be time to reach out to a contact thatâ€™s been inactive for a while; it identifies email messages that may be waiting for a reply from you; it alerts you when an opportunity is nearing its close date; and much more. These cards are displayed on forms, dashboards, and throughout the application to provide relevant information for the context you're working in at the moment.

## Create a custom card

You can generate these custom cards in two ways:  

- As a sales manager or administrator, you can generate custom insight cards (known as action cards) by using the **Assistant** which is based on Microsoft Flow. This provides you with a graphical user interface to generate custom cards. To learn more, see [Preview: Manage insight cards](manage-custom-cards-flow.md).

- As a developer, you can create card types according to your organizational requirements and make them available for users. To learn more, see [Sample: Create custom insight cards type](sample-extend-relationship-assistant-card-type.md)
