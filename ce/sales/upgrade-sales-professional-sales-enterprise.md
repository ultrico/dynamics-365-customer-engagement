## Move from Sales Professional to Sales Enterprise 

[!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional is targeted at businesses that have simpler sales needs and do not require the full sales capabilities. However, if at any point you find your requirements growing, you can easily upgrade to [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise. 

The upgrade process involves the following steps:

1. Purchasing a [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise subscription.

2. Assigning [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise licenses to the users.

3. Installing the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Enterprise edition solution.

4. Deleting the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] Professional solution. 

## Purchase Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise Edition subscription

1.  Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) with the Dynamics 365 account that has admin permissions.
