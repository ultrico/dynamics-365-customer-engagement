# Enable automatic generation of quote and invoice documents

Help your sales team to automatically generate quotes and invoice documents with consistent format and branding by using templates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature requires integration with SharePoint as the generated documents are stored in the SharePoint site. For more information, see [Configure Dynamics 365 Sales to integrate with SharePoint](connect-with-sharepoint.md). If you can't integrate with SharePoint, you can manually export the documents to PDF. For more information, see [Export sales records to PDF](create-quote-pdf.md).
