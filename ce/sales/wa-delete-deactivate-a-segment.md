# Delete or deactivate segments

Sometimes, you might want to get rid of segments that are no longer relevant or useful for your sales team's activities. You have two options to do this in Dynamics 365 Sales Hub:

- **Deactivate a segment** to keep it in the app but stop it from connecting to any new records. The records that were already connected to the segment remain connected. You can reactivate the segment later if you need it again.
- **Delete a segment** to remove it from the app completely. The records that were already connected to the segment in a sequence aren't affected. You can't undo this action.
