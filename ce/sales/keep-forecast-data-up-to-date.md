# Recalculate forecasts manually

You want the forecast data to be up-to-date to make informed decisions. Forecast data is automatically recalculated at regular intervals. However, you can trigger a manual recalculation when you want to recalculate the forecast data immediately. You can also trigger a manual recalculation for past and future periods as they aren't automatically recalculated. [Learn more about when and how forecast recalculation happens](forecast-recalculation-methods.md).
