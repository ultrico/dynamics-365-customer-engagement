## What are LinkedIn activities?

As a seller, you can use the LinkedIn network, which contains millions of users and offers a unique depth and quality of information that can help you research and connect with your customers. This functionality allows you to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator in your sequence to recommend the next best action.

When a sequence contains steps that are related to LinkedIn activities, you can perform the following actions to interact with customers:

-  Research a customer to learn more about their preferences. More information: [Research activity](#research-activity)
- Get introduced to a customer. More information: [Get introduced activity](#get-introduced-activity)
- Send personal messages to connect with a customer. More information: [Connect activity](#connect-activity)
- Send an InMail to a customer. More information: [Send InMail activity](#send-inmail-activity)

## Research activity

You can use the **Research** activity to view LinkedIn profiles, including customer contact and account information. This can help you to better understand customers before you start working with them.

You can perform the actions described in the following table.

|   &nbsp;     | Up next widget | Work list item |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|

| **Action** | Select **Show profile**. | Hover over the item, and then select the LinkedIn icon. |
| **Close the step** | Select **Mark complete**, to close the step and move to the next step. <br>or<br>Select **More options (...)**, and then choose an appropriate option:<ul><li>**Skip** to ignore the step.</li><li>**Snooze** to look into the step later.</li><li>**Assign** to transfer the step to a different seller.</li></ul> | Select **More options (&vellip;)**, and then choose an appropriate option:<ul><li>**Mark complete** to close the step and move to the next step.</li><li>**Skip** to ignore the step.</li><li>**Snooze** to look into the step later.</li><li>**Assign** to transfer the step to a different seller.</li></ul> |
