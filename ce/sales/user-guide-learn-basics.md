## Open your sales app

1. Visit the [Apps page](https://office.com/apps) on office.com.

2. Select one of the following cards depending on your license:

     1. For Sales Enterprise, select **Sales Hub**.

     If you don't see either of these cards, contact your Dynamics 365 administrator to get access.

| Number | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Open or collapse the site map. |
| 2      | Access the recent items you've worked on or the customers you've pinned. |
| 3      | Access everything that you need to communicate with customers, manage your pipeline, and other sales-related records. |
| 4      | Use the change area to switch between **Sales** and other settings. |
| 5      | Access the command bar for quick actions. |

## Quick create – Enter new records fast

The Quick Create command makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the navigation bar (also referred to as the nav bar), so it’s always available whenever you need to enter new info into the system.

With Quick Create, you need to complete only a few fields. Later, when you have more time or more information, you can fill in more details.

1. On the nav bar, select the **New** button and then select the record you want to create.

     :::image type="content" source="media/nav-bar.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Navigation bar highlighting the Quick Create button.":::

     > [!TIP]
     > On a mobile device, from the nav bar, tap :::image type="icon" source="media/ellipsis.png" border="false"::: and then tap **Quick Create Menu**.

2. Fill in the fields, and then select **Save**.

## Use Copilot to be productive and efficient

Copilot is an AI assistant that helps you find information related to your sales records. Copilot can quickly summarize information about your leads and opportunities, help you catch up on recent changes to your records, prepare for meetings, and enrich your leads with information from other sources. More information: [Use Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales](use-sales-copilot.md)

1. Select the Copilot icon :::image type="icon" source="media/copilot-icon.svg" border="false"::: in the top-right corner of the screen to open the Copilot side pane.

1. Select the sparkle icon :::image type="icon" source="media/sparkle-icon.png" border="false"::: to view the prompts you can use.
     For example, select **Get info** > **Summarize opportunity**, type "/", and then select the name of an opportunity. Copilot will summarize the key details of the opportunity for you.

## Feature highlights

Once you're in the app, you can start working on your sales processes.

Here are some highlights of Dynamics 365 Sales:

- **Visual insights.** The out-of-the-box dashboards and charts have almost everything that you need to get insight into your business.

    More information: [Gain insights with dashboards in Dynamics 365 Sales](dashboards.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/sales-manager-summary-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Sales Manager Summary dashboard.":::

- **Customer 360&deg; view.** Once in the app, quickly get an overview of what’s happening with a customer, such as communications with them, progress of individual deals, and much more, all in one place.

    :::image type="content" source="media/customer-360-view-contact-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Customer 360 view in the Contact form.":::

- **Business process flow.** The guided process flows on the **Lead and Opportunity** form tell you exactly what to do next. You can quickly find out the steps you must take to increase the likelihood of a successful sale and an increased sales count. The process bar can be docked to the right side of the screen for an omnipresent experience while you work on the opportunity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-process-flow-lead-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Business process bar on the lead form.":::

- **Activities timeline.** All the appointments you schedule while you work on an opportunity, the emails that you send or the phone calls you make are available in one place, giving you all the context you need to do your job.

    :::image type="content" source="media/activities-timeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Timeline of activities.":::

- **Store and view documents in the context of records.** Do you have presentations or documents for an opportunity all over the place? Store them all in one place, so anyone who’s working on the opportunity can view them!

    :::image type="content" source="media/documents-tab-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Documents tab in a form.":::

- **Simplified opportunity-to-invoice process.** It's easy to move a customer through the Sales funnel. Just generate a quote right from the opportunity you’re working on, and activate it. Use the same quote to quickly generate an invoice and mark the deal as won. You can also email the quotes and invoices to your customer in just one click.

    :::image type="content" source="media/opportunity-to-invoice-process.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the opportunity-to-invoice process.":::

- **Document templates.** The Word and Excel templates ensure that the documents that you’re sending out to your customers align with you company’s brand.

    More information: [Manage Word templates](manage-word-templates.md).

- **Sales data anywhere and everywhere.** Get all your customer and sales data right on your mobile device or tablet. Whether you're visiting a customer or on the road, you can quickly pull out your device to update the opportunity with information. What’s more—you get the same consistent experience regardless of the device you use.

## Understand the data in the app

Every day, you’ll work with different customer records and record types as you move customers through your business processes, collecting the data you need to fill in the fields for their records—and ultimately to win their business.

- What’s a record? In [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)], a **record** is a complete unit of information such as all the information about a single contact. You can think of it as a row in a table. For example, each time you add a new account to the app, you’re creating a new record in the Sales app.

- What’s a record type? Each record you add to the system belongs to a certain **record type**, such as an account, contact, lead, or opportunity.

## Business processes in Dynamics 365 Sales

Business processes help everyone follow best practices, even when handling situations that don’t occur often. You complete a step by entering data or marking the step completed in the process bar at the top of the screen. When all the steps are done, you can move on to the next stage.
