# Privacy and security FAQs

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-intro](~/../shared-content/shared/privacy-includes/gdpr-intro.md)]

## Where is the Dynamics 365 Sales data stored?  

Dynamics 365 Sales data is stored in Dataverse and in Azure resources (for certain features). Both Dataverse and the Azure resources are colocated with their respective Power Platform environment locations. For more information about Power Platform environment locations, see [Data Location](/power-platform/admin/wp-compliance-data-privacy#data-location).  

## Can the Dynamics 365 Sales data be protected with Customer Lockbox?

Yes, the Dynamics 365 Sales data is stored in the Power Platform environment and is protected with Power Platform Customer Lockbox. For more information, see [Securely access customer data using Customer Lockbox](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox).

Most of the Dynamics 365 Sales features fully support Customer Lockbox, except for the following features:

- **Conversation intelligence** doesn't support Customer Lockbox.

- **Forecasting** partially supports Customer Lockbox. Customer approval workflow is enabled for forecasting. However, as conversation intelligence and forecasting share the same infrastructure, the forecasting data isn't completely restricted for access until conversation intelligence supports lockbox. 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Microsoft supportâ€™s access to the forecasting and conversation intelligence data will continue to be managed by our internal customer data access approval process.

  
## Can the Dynamics 365 Sales data be encrypted using customer-managed encryption key (CMK)?

Yes, the Dynamics 365 Sales data can be encrypted using CMK. For more information, see [Manage your customer-managed encryption key](/power-platform/admin/customer-managed-key).

Most of the Dynamics 365 Sales features fully support Customer Lockbox, except for conversation intelligence.
