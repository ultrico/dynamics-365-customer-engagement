# Configure the assistant

Configure the assistant to help sellers track their daily actions and communications through a collection of actionable insight cards.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Configure the standard and premium assistant

The assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales helps sellers track their daily actions and communications through a collection of actionable insight cards.  
The assistant is available in two forms:  

- **Assistant (standard)**: This feature is included with Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise. The assistant comes with a set of out-of-the-box standard cards. As an administrator, you can configure which insight cards to present to users to help them stay on top of their day. Some insight cards are enabled by default; you can enable, disable, or customize the standard cards. To configure the standard assistant, see [Standard assistant](#standard-assistant).

- **Assistant (premium)**: The premium assistant is available in Sales with the Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license. With premium assistant capabilities, you can use Power Automate directly from the assistant studio to create custom insight cards, tailored to the specific needs of your team. To configure the premium assistant, see [Premium assistant](#premium-assistant).

## Standard assistant

### Prerequisites

Assign user privileges to give access to the assistant features. The privileges required to access Sales Premium features are automatically enabled for all out-of-the-box security roles, but they're initially disabled for all custom roles. If you enable any Sales Premium features, you must check the settings listed in the following table to help ensure that your users can access those features, and to help ensure that other features don't stop working because of privilege cascades related to these features.

|Privilege| Security role tab |Description and requirements|
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|
|**Action card**| **Core records**  |Gives the ability to view and interact with insight cards that are generated by the assistant. <br> **Warning:** If the assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when the assistant is enabled.|
| **Action card user settings** | **Core records**  | Gives the ability to view and change user preferences for insight cards that are generated by the assistant. **Warning:** If the assistant is enabled, all users *must* have a role with read access for this privilege. Because of cascading, users without this privilege lose access to many Dynamics 365 Sales features when the assistant is enabled. |

    Sellers can also set their own personal preferences for their insight cards. They can't add cards that you disable here, but they can disable cards that you enabled if they don't find them useful. They can also change the configuration settings for those cards that have them, though your settings are the defaults.
