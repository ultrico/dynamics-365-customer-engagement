# System requirements for Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps

Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps are free Dynamics 365 Sales apps from Microsoft. The Sales Hub app is preinstalled in your Dynamics 365 Sales environment and comes with several core and [premium features](overview.md#dynamics-365-sales-premium) to help you quickly get started with Dynamics 365 Sales. The Sales Professional app includes features and configurations that the [Sales Professional](overview.md#dynamics-365-sales-professional) customers are entitled to.  

This article lists the licensing and system requirements for these out-of-the-box sales apps.  

## System and license requirements

The system and license requirements to use the sales apps are as follows:

|Operating systems and browsers for web and mobile apps     |  The Sales Hub and Sales Professional apps are model-driven apps built using Power Apps.
