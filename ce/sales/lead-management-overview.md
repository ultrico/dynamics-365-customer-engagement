# Manage leads

Leads are potential customers who have shown interest in your products or services. Leads are the first step in the sales process. You can use Dynamics 365 Sales to manage leads and convert them into opportunities.

## Configure lead management

As an administrator, you can define the lead assignment rules, qualification experience, duplicate detection rules, lead scoring rules, and so on. These settings help your sales team to follow a streamlined process for managing leads.

- [Lead assignment rules](understand-lead-distributions-assignment-rules.md): Auto-assign leads to sellers based on certain rules. 

- [Lead qualification experience](define-lead-qualification-experience.md): Give your sellers the flexibility to choose which records to create—account, contact, or opportunity—when a lead is qualified.  

- [Duplicate lead detection](enable-duplicate-lead-detection.md): Enable duplicate lead detection to help your sellers identify and address potential duplicate leads.  
- [Predictive scoring rules](configure-predictive-lead-scoring.md): Help sellers increase the probability of winning a deal based on predictions from past data.
- [LinkedIn Sales Insights integration](/dynamics365/linkedin/integrate-sales-navigator): Integrate with LinkedIn Sales Navigator so that your sellers can get the most recent and relevant data of their leads from LinkedIn.

## Work with leads

As a seller, you create leads, use predictive scores to improve the lead conversion, and qualify and convert leads to opportunities.

- [Create a lead](create-edit-lead-sales.md): Use leads to keep track of business prospects.
  
- [Use predictive scores](work-predictive-lead-scoring.md): Use the predictive lead scoring feature to prioritize your leads based on scores.
- [Qualify and convert](qualify-lead-convert-opportunity-sales.md): Qualify a lead to convert it into an opportunity.
- [Use Copilot to be productive and efficient](copilot-get-information.md#summarize-a-lead): Use Copilot to quickly get up to speed with your leads. Ask Copilot to summarize a lead or get the recent changes made to a lead.
