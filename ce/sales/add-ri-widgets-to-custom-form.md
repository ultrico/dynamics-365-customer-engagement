# Add Relationship intelligence widgets to custom forms

By default, the health score widget and who knows whom widget are available only in the out-of-the-box **Sales Insights** form. If you're using customized forms, you can display these widgets on your custom forms by manually adding them to your form.

## Add widgets to a custom form

To add the health score widget or who knows whom widget to your custom form, follow these steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Widgets are only supported in Unified Interface apps.
> - You can't use the legacy form designer to add the widgets to a form.

1. Sign in to the [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) portal.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Power Apps home page](media/power-apps-home-page.png "Power Apps home page")

2. Search for and select your organization's environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Select your organization](media/power-apps-select-org.png "Select your organization")

3. Select **Data** > **Tables**.

    The **Tables** page opens with the list of tables.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Tables page with list of tables](media/power-apps-entities-page.png "Tables page with list of tables")

4. Open the table, select the **Forms** tab, and then select a main form to add the widget to. In this example, the table **Lead** is selected and the main form **Lead** is selected.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you're unable to view the table to which you want to add the widget, in the upper-right corner of the page, change the filters settings to **All**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Select the Lead main form on the Forms tab](media/power-apps-lead-main-form.png "Select the Lead main form on the Forms tab")

5. In the form designer, select **Component**, and then from **Layout**, add a column to the form as a placeholder to add the widget.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Add a column to the form](media/power-apps-layout-add-column-form.png "Add a column to the form")

7. Depending on the widget you want to add, do one of the following actions:
    - To add the health score widget, select **Display** > **Relationship Health**.
    - To add the who knows whom widget, select **Display** > **Who Knows Whom**.    
        >[!NOTE]
        >Ensure that the added placeholder column is selected. If it isn't, the widget will be added at a random place in the form.   
    In this example, let's select the **Who Knows Whom** widget.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Select the who knows whom widget](media/power-select-who-knows-whom-widget.png "Select the who knows whom widget")

8. In the pop-up window, select the components on which you want to display the widget, and select **Done**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Select Done to add the who knows whom widget](media/power-app-who-knows-whom-widget-options.png "Select Done to add the who knows whom widget")

    The widget is added to the form, as shown in the following image.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Who knows whom widget added to the form](media/power-app-who-knows-whom-widget-added.png "Who knows whom widget added to the form")

    >[!NOTE]
    >To hide the **New section** label, go to the **Properties** tab of the **New Section** settings pane, and then select **Hide label**.

9. Save and publish the form.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you'd like roles other than Salesperson and Sales Manager to access the who knows whom widget, [grant access to those roles](grant-access-wkw.md).
