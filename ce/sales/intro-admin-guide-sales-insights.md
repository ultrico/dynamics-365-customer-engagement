## Administer conversation intelligence

Conversation intelligence assists the sales managers and sellers in your organization to get an overview of the conversation with customers. Conversation Intelligence helps:

-    Sales managers drill down to get call statistics for individual sellers, such as customer sentiment, keywords used, and competitors mentioned in the conversation. Sales managers can use this data to give smarter coaching to sellers and improve the business.  
-    Sellers analyze their conversation data and identify improvements in the conversation style to enhance sales and generate revenue. 

As an administrator, when you sign in to the application for the first time, you can set up the application. After you complete the setup, sales managers and sellers in your organization can sign in and use the application seamlessly. More information: [First-run setup experience of Sales Insight application](fre-setup-sales-insight-app.md)

You can also update each setting later as required. The following configurations are available:

-    Connect your Sales environment to gather data and display on KPIs. More information: [Connect conversation intelligence to an environment](connect-dynamics365-sales-environment.md) 
-    Define keywords and competitors that are tracked in conversations. More information: [Configure keywords and competitors to track](configure-keywords-competitors.md)   
-    Define how long you want to retain the data in the application, and remove seller-specific data. More information: [Data retention and deletion through Privacy](data-retention-deletion-policy.md)   
-    Enable preview features. More information: [Enable preview features](enable-preview-features-sales-insights-app.md)

## For effective use of Sales Insights

- Use the out-of-the-box entities (Contact, Opportunity, Lead, Account, and Case) while creating records in the application. If changes to the entity are required in your organization, customize only these out-of-the-box entities to meet your requirements. This helps the application to analyze the records, and generate models and predictions effectively.

- Ensure that the **Change Tracking** option for the following entities are enabled: Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, System User, Team, Queue, Organization, Email, Phone Call, Task, Appointment, Activity Party, Connection, Business Unit, Metric, Opportunity Product, Product, Opportunity Sales Process, Process Stage, Connection Role, Workflow, Goal, Role, System User Roles, Note, Auto Capture Settings, Auto Capture Rule, and Lead To Opportunity Sales Process.

    1. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.    
    2. On the **Default Solution** page, expand **Entity**, and then select an entity.   
    3. On the **General** tab, under **Data Services**, verify that the **Change Tracking** option is enabled.

- Ensure that you don't delete the **Sales Insights MDL Config** solution from the solutions. If this solution is deleted, the Sales Insights features give inaccurate results and might be disabled. 

    However, if you want to delete the **Sales Insights MDL Config** solution due to storage issues, uninstall the **SalesInsightsAddOn** solution too. This ensures that the **Sales Insights MDL Config** solution won't be automatically reinstalled when future updates are pushed to your organization.
