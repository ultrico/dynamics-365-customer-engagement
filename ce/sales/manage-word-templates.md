### Step 1: Create a Word template

1.  Make sure you have the System Administrator role in Dynamics 365 Sales Professional.

2.  In the site map, select **Sales Settings**.

3.  Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Excel and Word Templates**.

4.  Select **New template**.

6.  In the **Select Entity** pane, select the entity to which the template applies. The template uses data from this entity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/select-entity-create-template-wizard.png" alt-text="Select entity in the Create Template wizard":::

7.  To add the fields that you want to be included in the Word template, select **Choose Related Entities**. The **Settings Overview** dialog box opens.

    The relationships you select on this screen determine which entities and fields are available later, when you define the Word template. Select only the relationships you need to add Dynamics 365 Sales Professional data to the Word template. When you’re done, select **Done**.

    Here are some example relationships for the Account entity:

    -   1:N Relationship. An account can have multiple contacts.

    -   N:1 Relationship. A lead, account, or contact can have multiple accounts.

    -   N:N Relationship. An account can have multiple marketing lists. A marketing list can have multiple accounts.

     > [!NOTE] 
     > To ensure documents download in a timely matter, there is an upper limit of 100 for the number of related records returned for each relationship. For example, if you’re exporting a template for an account, and you want to include a list of its contacts, the document will return at most 100 of the account’s contacts.

8.  In the **Select Entity** pane, select **Next**.

9.  In the **Download Template** pane, select **Download File** to create a Word file on your local computer with the exported entity included as XML data.

10.  To upload the template later, select  the **Upload the template later** check box, and then select **Done**.

11.  To upload the template after you customize the data, go to the list of templates, and then select **Upload template**. For more information, see the [Step 4: Upload the Word template back into the Sales app](#step-4-upload-the-word-template-back-into-the-sales-app).

### Step 2: Enable the Developer tab

Follow the instructions in [Step 2: Enable the Developer tab](/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context#step-2-enable-the-developer-tab) to enable the Developer tab in Word.

Follow the instructions in [Step 3: Define the Word template](/power-platform/admin/using-word-templates-dynamics-365?context=/dynamics365/context/sales-context#step-3-define-the--template) to define the Word template.
