# Set up branding and theming

You can create a custom look and feel (a theme), for your app by making changes to the default colors and visual elements provided in your system. For example, you can create your personal product branding by adding a company logo and providing table-specific coloring. The theme colors are applied globally throughout the application.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:

# [Sales Premium or Sales Enterprise](#tab/sales)

You can apply or create a theme in the Sales Hub app by selecting the **Settings** icon ![Settings icon.](media/settings-icon.png "Settings icon"), and then **Advanced settings** > **Customizations** > **Theme**. For more information on how to create a theme, apply an existing one, or update the logo, go to [Use a theme to create a custom look for your app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-themes-organization-branding).
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, youâ€™ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

# [Sales Professional](#tab/salespro)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capability is introduced in the Dynamics 365 Sales Professional app version 9.1.0.0.

You can enhance the following visual elements in the UI:

-   Product logos

-   Background color for the navigation bar (defined by **Nav Bar color**)

-   Color for the command bar, buttons, and tabs (defined by **Main Color**)

-   Color for the process bar (defined by **Accent Color**)
