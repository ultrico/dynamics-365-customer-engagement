# Grant access to who knows whom information

The Salesperson and Sales Manager roles have permissions to view who knows whom information in the contact and lead pages by default. Administrators can grant access to other roles.  

The who knows whom widget appears for all users who can open the Sales Insights view in contact and lead pages. Users who don't have sufficient privileges to view who knows whom information see a message to that effect.  

## License and role requirements
