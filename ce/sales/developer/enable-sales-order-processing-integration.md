# Enable sales order processing integration 

Connect Dynamics 365 Sales with an external order processing application by enabling this integration.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System customizer <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](../security-roles-for-sales.md)|


## How the integration works?

Sales order processing integration makes it convenient to connect Dynamics 365 Sales with an external back-office order processing application. It allows a sales order created on Dynamics 365 Sales to be submitted, after which the order can be synced to an external order processing application where the lifecycle of the order continues. A submitted order is locked for editing on Dynamics 365 Sales unless it was submitted by an integration user (to sync changes from the external order processing system to Dynamics 365 Sales). 

By default, sales order processing is turned off. When sales order processing is turned off, Dynamics 365 Sales allows invoices to be created from orders. More information: [Create an invoice from an order](../create-edit-invoice-sales.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Price computation can be triggered by Dynamics 365 Sales only if the sales entities like Opportunity, Quote, Sales order, and Invoice are editable.

## Enable the integration

To set up and enable the integration, see the [Power Platform integration documentation](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/overview).

## Turn on the integration

You can enable sales order processing integration by setting the value of the [IsSOPIntegrationEnabled](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/organization#BKMK_IsSOPIntegrationEnabled) column on the [Organization table](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/organization) to **Yes (1)**.

## What happens when sales order processing is turned on?

When sales order processing is turned on:  

- The **Create Invoice** button isn't shown on the command bar of the order records. 

- Order records will support a **Submit** order button. When the order is submitted, the status for the order is marked as `Submitted` and the order is made read-only, unless it was created by an integration user. More information: [IsIntegrationUser column](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/systemuser#BKMK_IsIntegrationUser)

The following table lists the conditions that need to be satisfied before Dynamics 365 Sales executes price computation for various entities.

## Turn off the sales order processing setting

By default, sales order processing integration is turned off. If you've [turned it on](#turn-on-the-integration) using the ```IsSOPIntegrationEnabled``` column, you can turn it off using the **App Settings** page or by setting ```IsSOPIntegrationEnabled``` to **No**.

1. Go to **Sales Hub**, and then select **App Settings**.
2. Select **General/Overview**, and then select **Back Office Order Processing Integration**.
3. Select **Manage**, and then set the toggle switch to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> The setting won't be visible in the **App Settings** page if the integration is turned off.
