## Enable or disable PDF generation

The PDF generation capability allows users to generate PDF files directly from Dynamics 365 records. The capability to create PDF files is supported for the following entities: Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, Quotes, Orders, and Invoices, on both web and mobile apps. You can select the entities on which you want to enable PDF generation. 

Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the 2020 release wave 2, the PDF generation capability is enhanced to support all custom entities. The PDF enhancements are limited to the web experience and aren't available in the mobile app. If you haven't opted in, or you're using Sales Hub on the mobile app, you'll see the old experience.

    2. To filter the list of entities and find a specific entity on which you want to enable PDF generation, use the **Filter by entity name** field.

5. Select **Save**.  
   PDF generation is enabled for the selected entities.

6. Review the out-of-the-box templates and create new templates as per your requirement. For more information, see [Create and manage Word templates](manage-word-templates.md). 
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't create a PDF file for an entity record if there's no template available for that entity.

After you enable PDF generation, sellers will be able to generate a PDF, download it to their local computer, save it to Dynamics 365 as Notes or save it to SharePoint.
