# Admin settings overview

Admin settings provide an organized and unified experience for administrators to easily configure the Dynamics 365 Sales app from a single place.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | [Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | [System Administrator](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Access admin settings

Select the tab for the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have:

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SE)

## Sales app settings

The Sales app settings include settings for core sales areas such as lead, opportunity, and product management, productivity tools, Teams and LinkedIn integration, and goals and forecasts.

To open the app settings, select **Change area** :::image type="icon" source="media/change-area-icon.png"::: at the bottom of the site map, and then select **App Settings**.

These settings are also available in the legacy web client. The Sales Hub app consolidates them in one place for ease of use.

The new unified settings experience is available only in the Sales Hub app by default. [Read our blog post to learn how to use the unified settings experience in a custom sales app](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2020/03/30/simplified-system-configuration-in-dynamics-365-sales/).

### Search and notifications

To quickly find a specific setting, start typing its name in the search box. The results are filtered to show only the settings that match your search criteria. The search results also show the navigation path to the setting.  
For quick access, the search box saves and displays the five most recent settings you searched for.  

The **App Settings** page displays notifications about the latest updates to keep you informed about new features and settings that can enhance your use of the app.

## Sales Insights settings

The Sales Insights settings include settings for standard and premium sales insights features such as sales accelerator, email engagement, relationship intelligence, and predictive scoring.

To open the Sales Insights settings, select **Change area** :::image type="icon" source="media/change-area-icon.png"::: at the bottom of the site map, and then select **Sales Insights Settings**.

To set up and use the premium sales insights features, you must have a Dynamics 365 Sales Premium license. [Learn more about Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/).

# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)

To manage the admin settings in Sales Professional, select **Sales Settings**.

### Get Started page

The **Get Started** page makes it easy to set up what's most important. One selection configures Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint so that your users can start sending emails and sharing documents right away. You can also import data quickly, so that your users have everything they need in the app. And if you want to change or customize anything later, you can find the standard settings in the same place.

### Standard settings

**Standard settings** are the most commonly used settings in the app. They include settings for email, SharePoint, data import, and user management. These configurations are simple and quick.

### Advanced settings

**Advanced settings** allow you to customize the app to meet your organization's requirements. They include settings for branding and theming, teams, Excel and Word templates, the quote to invoice process, and data export.

### Customization

If the Sales app doesn't exactly fit your business requirements, use the drag-and-drop designers under **Customization** to quickly change forms, views, and process flows to reflect the specific information your company needs. For example, change the pipeline phases to match your organization's business flows, or add new fields to capture data that's relevant to your business&mdash;all without writing a single line of code.
