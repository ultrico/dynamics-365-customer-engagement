# Use the Sales Hub app to access Dynamics 365 Sales features

Sales Hub is a free app from Microsoft that's preinstalled. It comes with several core and premium features to help you quickly get started with Dynamics 365 Sales. From the Sales Hub app, you can access Sales Premium features&mdash;such as sales accelerator, conversation intelligence, and predictive scoring&mdash;even if you have a Sales Enterprise license. Premium features are subject to monthly capacity limits for Sales Enterprise customers. For more information, go to [Digital selling capabilities in Sales Enterprise](digital-selling.md).

We recommend that you use the Sales Hub app unless your organization follows unique sales practices that warrant a custom app. For a comparison, refer to [Sales Hub app versus custom app](saleshub-customapp.md).

## Why should you use the Sales Hub app?

Sales Hub is a Microsoft first-party app that's designed for ideal seller experiences. Use the Sales Hub app to:

- Harness the power of data and intelligence to forecast, compare annual projections, and measure performance using predictive scoring

- Collaborate using Teams in Dynamics 365 to accelerate your pipeline while managers track team performance and provide coaching to increase customer satisfaction

- Access standard (and premium, if licensed) sales features almost instantly

The Sales Hub app can coexist with any custom sales apps that you might have in your organization. [Learn the benefits of using the Sales Hub app versus custom apps](saleshub-customapp.md).
