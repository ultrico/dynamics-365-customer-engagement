Enable system customizers to customize the opportunity close experience so that sellers can capture details about why an opportunity was closed.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|

## Enable customization

To allow users in your organization to capture more relevant details about an opportunity closing, a system administrator can enable the customization of the Opportunity Close form.

> The capability to customize the **Opportunity Close** form is supported only in the sales app built on Unified Interface.

Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SE)

If you have the Sales Hub app, follow the instructions in this tab. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the **Sales Professional** tab to configure the option in Power Platform.

1. In lower-left corner of the screen, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") and then select **App Settings**. 

1. In the site map, select **Overview**, and on the **Overview** page, select **Manage** for **Custom fields on closing form**.
1. On the **Opportunity Closing** page, turn the **Custom fields on closing form** toggle to **Yes**.

# [Sales Professional](#tab/SP)
