# What are preview features

This article describes what preview features are, what limitations apply to them, and how to identify them in your Dynamics 365 Sales trial. [Explore the features included in the trial](features-in-trial.md).

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Preview features come with some disclaimers. Preview features:

- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446).
- Aren't meant for production use.
- Aren't supported by Microsoft Support for production use. Microsoft Support is, however, eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best-effort support in certain cases.
- May have limited or restricted functionality.
- May not be available in all geographic areas.

## How to identify a preview feature

You get access to some preview features as part of your Dynamics 365 Sales trial. These features have a **Preview** label in the app and in the documentation. For example, refer to the [Preview: Manage opportunities using pipeline view](use-opportunity-pipeline-view.md) article.
