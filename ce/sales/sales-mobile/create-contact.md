## View details

> [!NOTE]
> - The fields that you see on the compact form are defined in the quick view form of the table.
> - The lightweight view doesn't include all attributes of the table.
> - This is a lightweight form that contains any attributes defined in the first form on quick view form set order. More information: [Set the form order](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/control-access-forms#set-the-form-order)

You can view the details of a contact in the following ways: 

**On the home page**    

The home page displays a list of contacts that you have recently accessed. When you tap a contact, the details are displayed partially at the bottom half of the screen. Scroll up for a quick view or tap ![Expand quick view icon.](media/expand-quick-view.png "Expand quick view icon") to display the complete contact details in a lightweight form.

**On the Meetings page**     

The Meeting details page displays contacts are invited for the meeting. Also, the notes and insights that are displayed in the meeting are related to the displayed regarding record. Tap a contact to view the details of the contact in a quick view form. 

In the following example, the details of a recent contact shown on the home page are displayed in a quick view form:   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open contact details.](media/sm-open-contact.png "Open contact details") 

## Edit contact details

If the contact already exists in your Dynamics 365 Sales organization, you can update the contact details, such as mobile number and business email, by using the edit option in the quick view form.  

In the upper-right corner of the quick view form, tap ![Edit icon.](media/edit-icon.png "Edit icon"). Edit the details in the **Edit** form and tap **Save**.

To open the record in the Sales Hub app, tap ![Open record icon.](media/open-record-icon.png "Open record icon").
