When you perform a search, the results are categorized according to the type of table, such as contacts, accounts, leads, notes, and opportunities. For example, if you searched for **contoso**, the results would include records that contain this text, including contacts, accounts, and leads. Tap the record to view more details. You can also tap **See all** to expand the list for a category.

Below the search box, you can see the number of records found in the search results. Next to the results count is an option to filter the results. You can narrow your results to include only relevant owners or record types, and limit results based on modified and created dates. Tap the filter icon (![Refine search results.](media/refine-search.png "Refine search results")), and then choose a filter option.
