# Overview of the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app 

Mobile apps help sellers build great customer relationships, stay up-to-date with important information, and respond to their customers faster. The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is optimized for core field seller scenarios to help sellers make use of the time that they spend on the road while traveling to meet customers. It helps sellers with the right data anywhere, anytime, and lets them log and share information quickly.

> [!NOTE]
> The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app doesn't work in Sovereign cloud and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).

In contrast to the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app, which is a model-driven app that you use to open any customer engagement app like Sales Hub or Customer Service Hub on mobile, the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is specifically designed for core sales scenarios while still supporting model-driven configurations. 

> [!NOTE]
> As the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app is specifically designed for core on-the-go sales scenarios, there are major differences between the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app and the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app. To know about the difference between Dynamics 365 Sales app and Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app, see [Difference between Dynamics 365 Sales app and Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app](#difference-between-dynamics-365-sales-app-and-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets-app).

With the Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app, you can do the following (and much more):

- **Plan your day**: Before you start your day, you want to see what it has in store. You can immediately see reminders about your customer meetings or insights for the day.

- **Do post-meeting work**: After you're out of a meeting, you can quickly add notes, create contacts, and update data in relevant records.

- **Find required information and act accordingly**: Find a contact you want to reach out to with ease, or find the recent records you worked on.

The Dynamics 365 Sales mobile app can be installed on [iOS](install-mobile-app.md#install-the-app-on-ios) and [Android](install-mobile-app.md#install-the-app-on-android).
