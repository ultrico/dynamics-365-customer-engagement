# Manage your accounts and contacts

In Dynamics 365 Sales, you use [accounts](#work-with-accounts) to store information about the companies you do business with. Use [contacts](#work-with-contacts) to store information about the people you work with at those companies. You can add multiple contacts to an account, but you can associate only one account with a contact. You can create accounts and contacts manually or import them from a spreadsheet or other supported files.

1. Optionally, [add contacts to the account](#add-contacts-to-an-account).

1. Select **Save & Close**.
