# Add products to an opportunity

Develop your opportunity by adding products, bundles or families that you want to sell,upsell, and cross-sell.


## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional  <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Any primary sales role, such as salesperson or sales manager<br>  More information: [Primary sales roles](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles)|


## Find and add products to an opportunity 

You can add a product that already exists in the [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] product catalog or add a Write-in product. Any products added to an opportunity are automatically associated with quotes generated from the opportunity.

**To find and add products:**

1. In the Sales Hub site map, select **Opportunities**.

2. Open the opportunity to which you want to add products.

3. Go to the **Products** tab.

4. Select a **Price list**. The price list determines the cost of the product. 
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, you must select a price list to be able to add products to an opportunity; however, your administrator can change your organization settings to make the **Price list** field optional.

4. If you want the estimated revenue of the opportunity to be calculated based on the total number of products, set **Revenue** to **System Calculated**. If you want to use a custom estimated revenue, set it to **User Provided**.

5. Select **Add product**.

6. In the **Quick Create: Opportunity Product** form, do the following:  

    1.  **Select Product**: Set the switch to choose whether you want to add an existing product or create a new one:
    
         -  To use an existing product, select **Existing** to search for and add a product.
 
             > [!NOTE]
             >
            > - When a price list is selected for the opportunity, the products listed in the **Existing Product** field are filtered by the price list. This means that only the products associated with the selected price list are shown in this field. In this case, the default view is set to **Products in Parent Price List** view. You can't set a custom view as the default view. Even if you do, the Products lookup will automatically set it back to **Products in Parent Price List** view.
             > - When a price list isn't selected, the **Existing product** field shows all active products (not filtered by the price list). You can change the view to look for other products by selecting the **Change View** icon. 
             > - By default, the product lookup will show the most recently used products. The most recently used products aren't filtered based on the selected price list. 
             > - If a price list is selected and you select a product that isn't associated with the price list, you'll see an error. Select a product that's associated with the selected price list.

         -  To add an adhoc product, select **Write-In**, and then enter the name of the product.
    
    2.  **Price Overridden**: Select the pricing option. By default, this is the per unit price that's listed in the product catalog. To override the catalog price, select **Override Price**: When you override the price, you can specify a price that you want to charge for each unit of the product.

    3.  **Quantity**: Enter the quantity of the product or service that will be included.  

    4.  **Manual Discount Amount**: If you want to offer a discount to the product price, enter it here.  
    
    5.  **Tax**: If required, enter the appropriate tax amount.  
   
7. To save this product and add more products, select **Save & Create New**.

8. To save this product, select **Save and Close**.

The **Products** grid shows all the products that are associated with the opportunity. If you added an existing product from the product catalog, you can change the quantity and discount of the product inline in the **Products** grid. If you added a Write-in product, you can also change the price of the product in addition to the quantity and discount.

You can take the following actions on the products added to the **Products** grid.

|To                                    |Do This                                                       |
