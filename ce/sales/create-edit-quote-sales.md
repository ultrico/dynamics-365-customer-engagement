## How to create or edit quotes 

Most sales begin with a price quote, which eventually becomes an order. You'll probably edit a quote multiple times as a sale progresses. Initially, you create a draft, and then you need to activate it when it's ready to go to a customer.
When the customer accepts the quote, you create an order. Otherwise, you close the quote as revised, canceled, or lost.  

## Create a quote from an opportunity

1. Select the site map  ![Site Map icon.](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Opportunities**.

2. Select the opportunity you want to create a quote for.

3. Go to the **Quotes** tab and then select **New Quote**.

   The quote form opens. The quote form is prefilled with details from the opportunity record, including products added to the opportunity. 
6. Add more products or remove existing ones from the **Products** area. [Learn more about how prices are calculated for a quote](#how-prices-are-calculated-for-a-quote).

4. Enter shipping and payment information in the **Shipping Information** area of the **Quote** form.

5. Enter the billing and shipping addresses in the **Addresses** area of the **Quote** form.

8. Save the changes.

9. When your quote is ready to be sent to your customer, select **Activate Quote** on the command bar.

> [!NOTE]
> Your base record and all its line items must use the same currency. For example, if your quote has the currency set to U.S Dollars, you must use the same currency for the price list items that you add to the quote. You can't change the currency of the base record (in this case, an quote), unless you remove all the line items associated with the record.
> Similarly, if the quote is created from an opportunity, it must use the same currency as the opportunity.

## Create a quote

1. Select the site map ![Site Map icon.](media/site-map-icon.png "site map icon"), and then select **Quotes**.

2. Select **New**.

3. On the **Quote** form, enter data in the following required fields:

    -  **Name** 
  
    -  **Price List** and **Currency**: The price list that will be used to calculate the product prices and currency. [Learn more about how prices are calculated for a quote](#how-prices-are-calculated-for-a-quote).

        > [!NOTE]
        > By default, selecting a price list is required to be able to add products a quote. However, your administrator can change your organization settings to make the Price list field optional. More information: [Allow adding products without associated price list](make-price-list-optional.md)

4. In the **Sales Information** section, in **Potential Customer**, enter information about the customer you're creating this quote for.

5. Save the quote to proceed with adding products. 

6. To add products from an opportunity to your quote, select **Get Products** at the top of the **Quote** form, select an opportunity, and then select **OK**.
  
    -OR-

    To manually add other products, in the **Products** section, select **Add Product**. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add products to Quote, invoice, or order records](add-product-quote-order-invoice.md)

7. In the **Shipping Information** area, enter shipping details.

8. In the **Addresses** area, enter shipping and billing addresses.

9. Select **Save**.

10. When your quote is ready to be sent to your customer, select **Activate Quote** on the command bar.  

## How prices are calculated for a quote

The price calculation for a quote depends on the product catalog, line items, pricing rules, discounts, and taxes. It also varies based on the quote phase such as draft, active, or closed. 
  
- **Draft state**: During the draft phase, pricing calculations are based on the following elements:

    * **Product catalog**: Includes a product catalog with products/services available for quoting.  

    * **Price list**: Defines the price of the products included in the quote. 
    * **Line items**: Includes the products/services that you've added as line items to the quote, along with the quantity.  
    * **Pricing rules**: Determines the price of a product or service based on various factors such as volume discounts, customer-specific pricing, contract terms, or any other configured criteria.  
    * **Discounts**: Specifies the discounts to be applied to individual line items, or the overall quote based on specific conditions or negotiations with the customer. Discounts can be percentage-based or fixed amounts.  
    * **Taxes**: Specifies the tax rules that are configured to calculate applicable taxes based on the product, customer location, and other relevant factors.  
  
    In the draft state, the prices are adjusted to the actual prices on the price list when you open or edit the quote. The overall price is calculated by adding the price of all the products in the quote and deducting any applied discounts.
  
- **Active state**: The active quote state has the same price as the draft state. However, the overall amount is locked and can't be modified after it's published. 
  
- **Closed phase**: In the closed state, the price is typically based on the agreed-upon terms between the seller and the customer. Once the quote is closed, prices are considered fixed and no longer subject to changes unless a new quote or agreement is created.  

    In the active and closed states, the prices are not adjusted to the actual prices on the price list when you open or edit the quote.
  
## Export to PDF

When you've added all the details to the quote, you can send it to the customer. To directly send an email to a customer with a quote attached, open the quote, select **Export to PDF** on the command bar.
