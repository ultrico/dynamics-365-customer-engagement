# Set up conversation intelligence in Sales Hub app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting June 2024, Conversation intelligence will use Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to process call data and transcripts. If your Dynamics 365 Sales organization is in a region where Azure OpenAI Service isn't available, your call data and transcripts will be processed in the nearest region where Azure OpenAI Service is available.

Using Microsoft Teams or other third-party dialers together with conversation intelligence in Dynamics 365 Sales helps organizations transform customer interactions into revenue. Calling with these dialers allows sellers to view business-critical insights both during the call&mdash;in real-time&mdash;and after.

As an administrator, configure conversation intelligence for the dialer that your sellers use.  

If you have the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license, you can enable Teams call recording through quick setup. Go to the **Get started with digital sales** page under **App Settings** in your sales app. 

[Learn more about conversation intelligence for Sales Enterprise license](digital-selling-microsoft-teams-calls.md).

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium or Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator<br>More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Prerequisites for Microsoft Teams

- An installation of Microsoft Teams Phone System along with a valid license to use it. [Set up your phone system](/microsoftteams/setting-up-your-phone-system).
- A license to use Teams. [Learn more about Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing?tabs=small-business).

- [Teams dialer enabled and configured for your organization](configure-microsoft-teams-dialer.md)
- (Optional) [Set up own storage for call recordings](create-azure-repo.md) if you want to use your own Azure storage for storing call recordings and transcripts, and the call insights. Otherwise, the application uses Microsoft-provided storage.

## Prerequisites for third-party dialers

- A valid license and subscription to use the third-party dialers. Refer to your telephony provider's documentation to set up the phone system and dialer.

- [Integrate the third-party dialer with Dynamics 365 Sales](ci-third-party-sp-integration.md).  

## Open the conversation intelligence settings page

1. Select **Change area** in the lower-left corner of the page, and then select **Sales Insights settings**.  

1. Under **Productivity**, select **Conversation intelligence**.

## Create or edit a recording policy

Recording policies define the call provider, security roles, and recording options. You can create multiple recording policies and assign them to different security roles. For example, you can create a recording policy for your sales managers that allows them to record calls automatically and another one for your sales representatives that allows them to record calls manually. If your sellers use multiple call providers, you can create a recording policy for each provider.

1. [Open the **Conversation intelligence settings** page](#open-the-conversation-intelligence-settings-page).

1. In the **Call providers and recording** section, select your call provider. For example, select **Teams** to create a recording policy for your Teams calls. To edit an existing policy, select the policy from the **Recording policies** table in this section.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This section lists only those providers that are configured and integrated. If you don't see your provider listed, verify the prerequisites listed in this article.

This table is available under custom entities.  <br>**Tips:**<br><ul><li>To implement the feature for your entire organization, select all security roles.</li><li>For a phased implementation, create different security roles for each group of users and then [assign the security role](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles) accordingly.</li></ul>|

1. Save the changes. If you're configuring conversation intelligence for the first time, continue with the next section to configure the conversation intelligence settings.

## Configure conversation intelligence settings

Configure the settings to specify where your call recording data is stored, the retention period, and the keywords and competitors that you want to track during calls. 

1. [Open the **Conversation intelligence settings** page](#open-the-conversation-intelligence-settings-page).

1. In the **Call recording storage** section, configure the storage-related options as described in the following table.

    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Storage for call recordings | Select an option to store your call recordings for analysis:<br><ul><li>**Microsoft provided storage**: Select this option to use storage provided by Microsoft. This option is selected by default, and we recommend that you don't change it unless you need to retain call recording data for longer than 90 days.</li><li>**Your own Azure storage**: Select this option to use your own Azure storage. You must select this option to retain call recording data for longer than 90 days. After you select this option, enter the **Storage name** and **Container name** that you've created for conversation intelligence in your Azure portal. [Learn more about configuring your own storage](create-azure-repo.md). <br></li></ul>|
    | Retention policy | Select how long to retain call recording data. The application deletes the data when it reaches the time limit. [Learn more about data retention and access](data-retention-deletion-policy.md).<br>For Microsoft-provided storage, the available retention periods are 30 days and 90 days. If your organization requires a longer retention period, you'll need to use your own storage. |
