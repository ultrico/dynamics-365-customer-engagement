## What are customers talking about?

The **What are customers talking about** section helps you to understand what's happening in sales calls and what customers are talking about. These insights can provide you with possible ideas for coaching scenarios for your sales team, helping them improve their performance during the sales calls. 

This also helps in driving strategic motion by looking at the keywords, brands, and competitors mentioned during the call. For example, "3D printer" is trending more during customer calls, but 3D printer sales aren't reaching targets. You can coach the sales team on how to sell 3D printers more effectively to customers.


The following insights are available for you to understand what customers are talking about:

-	[Customer sentiment](#customer-sentiment)

-	[Tracked keywords](#tracked-keywords)

-	[Tracked competitors](#tracked-competitors)

-	[Other brands and organizations](#other-brands-and-organizations)

### Customer sentiment

This insight shows the number of calls where the customer sentiments are more negative than average. Using this insight, you can:

- Analyze pain points that customers express during the call, and coach your sellers on how to handle customer conversations well. 
- Analyze why customers are expressing these pain points, and identify selling opportunities by addressing the gaps that are causing pain points. 

The following image is an example of how the "customer sentiment" insight is displayed.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Customer sentiment.](media/si-app-customer-sentiment.png "Customer sentiment")

In this example, you can see that 200 calls have been analyzed and 27 percent of them have higher than the average negative customer sentiment. The doughnut chart shows the percentage of calls that are positive, neutral, and negative.

Select **Show details** to view more details on how the customer sentiment is trending over time and the list of calls that contributed to this analysis. Furthermore, you can select each call and view the summary. To learn more about call summary, see [View and understand call summary](view-and-understand-call-summary.md).

In this example, you can see that STL (+32 percent), Jewelers (+26 percent), and Fabrication (+23 percent) are the keywords that are trending the highest, so you could theoretically define a sales strategy related to these keywords. The bubbles show the top 20 tracked keywords and the number of times that these keywords were mentioned in calls. 

You can define what keywords you want to track during the sales call. To learn more, see [Configure keywords and competitors to track](configure-keywords-competitors.md).

Select **Show details** to view more details on top trending keywords. The details include how many times each keyword is mentioned in the total number of calls, the trend of each keyword over time, and the list of calls that are contributing to the keyword analysis.

### Other brands and organizations

This insight helps to discover new products, brands, and organizations that customers are speaking about in sales calls, which they never spoke of in previous calls. These products, brands, and organizations aren't defined in the application (under tracked keywords and competitors); the application uses the Microsoft Bing knowledge repository to identify the products, brands, and organizations to display. Using this insight, you can identify whether any competitor brands and organizations are mentioned on the sales calls and update your sales strategies accordingly.

In this example, you can observe that when comparing how much they talk compared to how much they listen, the top sellers talk less than the team does on average (59 percent compared to 61 percent), and they listen more than the team does on average (41 percent compared to 39 percent). Through this insight, you can learn that talking less is helping the top sellers generate revenue, and you can suggest it as a best practice for other sellers to follow.
