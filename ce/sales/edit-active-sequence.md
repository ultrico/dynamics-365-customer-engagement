# Edit an active sequence and view version history 

When you've changed the process of an active sequence, you can create a new version of the sequence without deactivating it. You can update a sequence multiple times, and when you connect a record to the sequence, the record will be connected to the latest version.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The records that were connected to a previous version of the sequence remain connected to that previous version.

## View version history and associated records

Viewing the version history helps you to understand the number of versions that have been created for a sequence, and view the records that are connected to each version.    

1.	Open the sequence.

1.	To view the version history, select **Version history**.   

    A list of versions that exist for the sequence is displayed on the right pane.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select version history option](media/sequence-version-select-version-history.png "Select version history option")

    The current selected version is highlight with a Blue line corresponding to the version name.  

    >[!NOTE]
    >If there are no leads connected to the sequence, and you created a new version, only the latest version is displayed in the list.

1.	To view the version of the sequence to which a record is connected, go to the **Connected *records*** tab. In this example, we selected the **Connected leads** tab.    

    A list of leads that are connected to the sequence is displayed, along with the version to which they're connected.   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![View the list of leads with associated versions](media/sequence-version-view-leads-list.png "View the list of leads with associated versions")
