# Insights generated from Microsoft 365 data

Dynamics 365 Sales uses your emails and meeting information from Exchange to generate the following relationship insights:

- [Relationship analytics and health](#relationship-analytics-and-health)
- [Who knows whom](#who-knows-whom)

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is using Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, then your Exchange data will be used to enrich customer data. For more information, see [Enrich customer profiles with data from Microsoft Office 365](/dynamics365/customer-insights/enrichment-office).

Your Microsoft 365 admin needs to [provide consent](provide-consent-office365.md) to let Dynamics 365 collect and use Microsoft 365 data. For information about the different consent types, see [Consent required to use Microsoft 365 data](ms365-consent-types.md).  

As a user, if you'd like to opt out of sharing your data, you can [turn off data sharing with Dynamics 365 applications](who-knows-whom.md#turn-off-data-sharing-with-dynamics-365-applications).


## Relationship analytics and health

Relationship analytics provides a comprehensive view of the overall health and trend of your business relationships based on your sellers interactions with your customers through emails and activities in Dynamics 365 and Exchange. It calculates the KPIs and activity histories for any contact, opportunity, lead, or account. With these insights, you can identify critical opportunities and customer relationships that need your attention.

The following screenshot is an example of how relationship analytics data appears for open opportunities:

For more information on how to set up and use this feature, go to [Configure relationship analytics and health](configure-relationship-analytics.md) and [Use relationship analytics to gather KPIs](relationship-analytics.md).

## Who knows whom

Who knows whom helps you identify colleagues who can introduce you to a lead or contact based on their email interactions with the lead. An introduction can increase the chances of a positive outcome. This feature provides you with details such as the names and email addresses of your colleagues and the strength of their connection to the lead.

The following screenshot is an example of the **Who Knows Whom** widget on a lead page:

For more information on how to set up and use this feature, go to [Configure who knows whom](configure-who-knows-whom.md) and [How to get introduced to leads or contacts](who-knows-whom.md).
