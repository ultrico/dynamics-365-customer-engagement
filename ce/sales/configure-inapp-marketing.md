    |Setting  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |Create campaign responses for incoming email     |If this option is set to **Yes**, the app automatically creates a campaign response  when an email is received in response to a specific marketing campaign. <br> **Note:** If a customer sends multiple replies to campaign email, only the first reply is tracked as a campaign response. <br>**Default:** Yes        |
    |Set "Do Not Send Marketing Material" option when an unsubscribe email is received     |If this option is set to **Yes**, when an unsubscribe email is received, the preference setting for the account, contact, or lead gets updated automatically to not send marketing materials. If this option is set to **No**, the unsubscribe email will be ignored and the user will continue to get marketing email communications. If you're providing an option to unsubscribe in the campaign emails, we recommend that you set this option to **Yes**.<br> More information: [Let your customers unsubscribe from marketing communications](get-started-app-marketing-sales.md#let-your-customers-unsubscribe-from-marketing-communications)<br> **Default:** No        |
