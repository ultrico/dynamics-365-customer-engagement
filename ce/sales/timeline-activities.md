# Track activities in timeline

The timeline control lets you create and view all the activities related to a record in one place. You can view activities such as emails, appointments, phone calls, notes, and tasks recorded in Dynamics 365 Sales.

For account and contact records, you can also view activities from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and get the most recent and complete picture about activities related to your customers. Contact your administrator to understand whether the integration is configured for your organization.

## Manage activities in the timeline

Open a record to view the timeline control and the activities related to the record. You can sort and filter the timeline based on your preferences.
