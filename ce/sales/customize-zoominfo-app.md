# Customize the ZoomInfo app     

After you install the ZoomInfo app, it's available as a standalone app, so every time sellers must come back to the app selection area and choose ZoomInfo to view the required information. 

As an administrator, you can customize the ZoomInfo app in the following ways:   
-	**Add ZoomInfo entry to the site map**: You can add the ZoomInfo entry to your Dynamics 365 Sales app on the left navigation site map and provide easy access to ZoomInfo, including the Admin Portal and ZoomInfo Knowledge Center. More information: [Add ZoomInfo entry to site map](#add-zoominfo-entry-to-site-map).
-	**Add ZoomInfo form to table entities**: You can add the ZoomInfo form to standard or custom Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities to provide sellers with inline access to ZoomInfo data. More information: [Add ZoomInfo form to entities](#add-zoominfo-form-to-table-entities).

## Add ZoomInfo entry to site map
By adding ZoomInfo entry to the left navigation site map of your Dynamics 365 Sales app, you allow sales teams to perform searches and administrators to access the Admin Portal in order to configure export preferences, custom mapping, and other settings. You can also add site map entry to the ZoomInfo Knowledge Center.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![ZoomInfo site map is added to the left navigation pane](media/zoominfo-sitemap-added.png "ZoomInfo site map is added to the left navigation pane")   

## Add ZoomInfo form to table entities    
You can add the ZoomInfo form to standard or custom Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities. This allows sellers to access the ZoomInfo data without moving away from records.

To do this, follow this sequence of steps:
1.	[Create a solution](#create-a-solution)
2.	[Add solution components to table entity](#add-solution-components-to-table-entity)
3.	[Add form to table entity](#add-form-to-table-entity) 
4.	[Customize form components](#customize-form-components)

### Create a solution

Create a solution to locate and work with the components you’ve customized and then apply them to the Power Platform environment that hosts your Dynamics 365 apps. This makes it easier to return to your custom solution to make future changes.  

**To create a solution:**    
1.	Sign in to the [Power Apps portal](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/) and choose the organization in which you’ve installed the ZoomInfo app.
2.	On the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.   
3.	Select **New solution** and on the **New solution** pane, enter the information as described in the following table:    

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Display Name | The name shown in the list of solutions. You can change this later. |
    | Name | The unique name of the solution. This is generated using the value you enter in the Display Name column. You can edit this before you save the solution, but you can't change it once it's been saved. |
    | Publisher | You can select the default publisher or create a new publisher. We recommend creating a publisher for your organization to use consistently across the Power Platform environments where you'll use the solution. |
    | Version | Enter a number for the version of your solution. This is only important if you export your solution, as the version number will be included in the file name. |

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enter new solution information](media/zoominfo-solution-add-solution.png "Enter new solution information")   

4.	Select **Create**.  
    
    The new solution is created and listed in the solutions.

### Add solution components to table entity    
You can now add components that aren’t available in the solution. In this example, we're adding a table component to Account, Contacts, and Leads entities.   
1.	Open the solution you've created and select **Add existing** > **Table**.    

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select the table option](media/zoominfo-solution-add-table-entity.png "Select the table option")   

2.	On the **Add existing tables** pane, add the tables **Account**, **Contacts**, and **Leads**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add tables Account, Contacts, and Leads](media/zoominfo-solution-add-tables.png "Add tables Account, Contacts, and Leads")   

3.	Select **Next**.    
    
    The three tables you selected are displayed.

### Add form to table entity   
Now that you've added the Account, Contacts, and Leads table entities to the solution component, add the form component for each table entity.    
1.	Under the **Account** section, select **Select components**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select components in the account section](media/zoominfo-solution-select-component-tables.png "Select components in the account section")   
 
2.	On the **Account** pane, select the **Forms** tab and then select **Account**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select account from the forms tab](media/zoominfo-solution-select-account-form.png "Select account from the forms tab")   
 
3.	Select **Add**.   
    
    Under the **Account** section, you will see the message **1 form selected**, indicating that you've added the account form to the **Account** table.   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Confirmation for successful addition of account form](media/zoominfo-solution-selected-account-form-added.png "Confirmation for successful addition of account form")   
 
4.	Repeat **steps 1 through 3** for the **Contact** and **Lead** table entities to add the corresponding contact and lead form to each.  
  
6.	Select **Add**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Account, contacts, and leads tables added to ZoomInfo iframe](media/zoominfo-solution-selected-tables-added-iframe.png "Account, contacts, and leads tables added to ZoomInfo iframe")

### Customize form components   
Now that you've added the forms to the table entities, you can customize how the ZoomInfo inline pages will display within the standard form component used with your Account, Leads, and Contacts pages. Perform the customization in classic mode.

1.	From the form page of the **Account** form, select **Switch to classic**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open account form in classic mode](media/zoominfo-solution-account-form-classic-mode.png "Open account form in classic mode")   
 
2.	Select the **Insert** tab and then select **One column**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select one column from insert tab](media/zoominfo-solution-select-one-column.png "Select one column from insert tab")   
 
    A new column is added as a **Tab**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Selected one column added to form](media/zoominfo-solution-one-column-added.png "Selected one column added to form")   
 
3.	Select the **Tab** and then select **Change Properties**. The **Tab Properties** dialog opens.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Tab properties dialog](media/zoominfo-solution-tab-properties.png "Tab properties dialog")   
  
4.	Enter the values for **Name** and **Label** as **ZoomInfo**, and then select **OK**. The tab is then renamed as **ZoomInfo**.

6.	Go to the **INSERT** tab in the **ZoomInfo** tab. Select the **Section** area and then select **Web Resource**. 
    The **Add Web Resource** dialog opens.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add Web Resource dialog](media/zoominfo-solution-add-webresources.png "Add Web Resource dialog")   
 
6.	Under the **General** tab, enter the following information:   
    -	In the **Web resource** section, search and add the `zi_InlineIframe.html` file that is built into the ZoomInfo for Dynamics 365 app.
    -	In the **Field Name and Properties** section, enter the **Name** and **Label** as **ZoomInfo**.
    -	In the **Web Resource Properties** section, check to select the **Pass record object-type code and unique identifier as parameters** option. This option helps ZoomInfo with the object type passed to perform data matches.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enter values in general tab](media/zoominfo-solution-enter-values-general-tab.png "Enter values in general tab")   
 
7.	Under the **Formatting** tab, in the **Row Layout** section, change the **Number of Rows** value to **16** to accommodate the ZoomInfo data.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enter values in format tab](media/zoominfo-solution-enter-values-format-tab.png "Enter values in format tab")   
 
8.	Select **OK**.
9.	Save and publish the form.   
    
    The **ZoomInfo** tab is added to the **Accounts** form. To verify, go to Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app and open the standard account page for a company. The **ZoomInfo** tab should be added to the account.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![ZoomInfo home page for an account record](media/zoominfo-solution-account-home-screen.png "ZoomInfo home page for an account record")   
 
10.	Repeat **steps 1 through 9** for the **Contact** and **Leads** forms.
