# Customize the Add Products dialog

Customize the **Add products dialog** so that your sellers can see important product details while adding products to opportunity, quote, order, or invoice records in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## License and role requirements
| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator <br> More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customizations described in this topic must be done within a custom solution. For more information, see [Why you shouldn't use the default solutions to manage customizations](/power-platform/alm/use-solutions-for-your-customizations#why-you-shouldnt-use-the-default-solutions-to-manage-customizations)

## What can you customize?

You can customize the following components of the **Add product** dialog to help sellers identify and add products quickly:

- Add more columns to the products grid. More information: [Add or remove columns in the grid](#add-or-remove-columns-in-the-grid)

- Add more attributes to the **Product** column. More information: [Add or edit attributes in the Product column](#add-or-edit-attributes-in-the-product-column)
    > [!NOTE]
    > Attributes in the **Product** column help sellers get more information *before* choosing a product. So, if you want to add a category or product ID to help distinguish products from each other, add it to the **Product** column. On the other hand, if sellers need to perform an action *after* selecting a product&mdash;for example, choosing delivery priority (a custom attribute)&mdash;add that attribute to the grid.
- Customize the fields to search. More information: [Customize the fields to search](#customize-the-fields-to-search)

## Add or remove columns in the grid

By default, the **Add products** dialog displays the following columns in the grid:

- Product name
- Unit
- Price per unit
- Quantity

You can add other columns that are relevant to your business by customizing the add products view. Depending on the Dynamics 365 Sales license you have, select one of the following tabs for specific information:  

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SEAddColumns)

If you have the Sales Hub app, follow the instructions in this tab. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the **Sales Professional** tab to configure the option in Power Apps.

**To add or remove columns in the grid**

1. In the Sales Hub app, select the **Change area** icon ![Icon to change the work area.](media/change-area-icon.png "Icon to change the work area") in the lower-left corner of the page and then select **App Settings**.  

2. Under **Product Catalog**, select **Product Catalog Settings**.  

3. Turn on the **Enhanced experience for adding products** option, if you haven't already.  
    You see more options to customize the **Add products dialog** for
    opportunity, quote, invoice, and order.  

4. Select the add products view of the entity that you want to customize. For example, select **Quote 'add products' view**  to customize the **Add products dialog** for quotes.  
    You're redirected to the corresponding view in Power Apps.

5. Select **View Column** and then select the columns you want to add to the grid. Or, just drag-and-drop the columns into the grid.

6. To remove a column, select the column in the grid and select **Remove**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Though you can add filters to the view, they won't be applied to the Add products dialog. The dialog will always display all products.

7. Select **Publish** to save and publish the customizations.
    The changes are applicable to the **Add products dialog** of the selected entity.

8. Open the entity you customized. If you customized the add products view for quotes, open a quote and then select **Add products**. Verify whether the customizations to the grid are reflected in the dialog.

    |Quote Product     | Quote products Add Products        |
    |Order Product     | Order products Add Products         |

2. Add or remove columns as per your requirement. For step-by-step instructions, see [Choose and configure columns in views](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/choose-and-configure-columns#add-columns-to-views).

## Add or edit attributes in the Product column
