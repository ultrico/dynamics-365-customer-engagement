# Connect Conversation intelligence app to an environment  

If you have multiple environments in your organization, you can connect the Conversation intelligence app to more than one environment. This will allow you to switch to different environments from the Conversation intelligence app and view the call insights. 

At a time, you can have only one active environment that is connected to the application. When you activate an environment, the existing environment will automatically deactivate, and the new environmentâ€™s data 
will be displayed on the application. 

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout this article, environment refers to a [Power Platform environment with a Dataverse database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database) that hosts Dynamics 365 Sales.
