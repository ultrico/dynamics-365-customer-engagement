# Customize the sales accelerator workspace

Customize the sales accelerator workspace by configuring filters, sorting, and the appearance of work items.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, or [Microsoft Relationship Sales](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/relationship-sales/)<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator or Sequence Manager<br>More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md) |

## Customize the workspace for sellers

After the [first-run setup of the sales accelerator](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md#first-run-setup), you can customize the workspace to meet your sellers' needs. For example, if sellers want to filter work items based on currency type for leads, add a filter with the record type **Lead** and the field **Currency**. [Learn how sellers can use custom filters](prioritize-sales-pipeline-through-work-list.md#custom-filters).

1. Sign in to the Sales Hub app. In the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** ![change area.](media/change-area-icon.png) > **Sales Insights settings**.
1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Workspace**.

1. In the **Customize workspace** section, select **Filtering and sorting**.
    The **Filters** page opens. Here you can do the following tasks:

    - [Manage filters](#manage-filters)
    - [Manage sorting](#manage-sorting)

    :::image type="content" source="media/sa-filters-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Filtering and sorting page.":::

## Manage filters

Filters help your sellers target specific work items in the sales accelerator workspace. In the **Filter** tab of the **Filtering and sorting** page, you can:

- [Add basic and advanced filters](#add-basic-and-advanced-filters)
- [Add groups](#add-groups)
- [Hide filters](#hide-filters)
- [Edit custom filters and groups](#edit-custom-filters-and-groups)
- [Move filters to a group](#move-filters-to-a-group)
- [Delete custom filters and groups](#delete-custom-filters-and-groups)

### Add basic and advanced filters

You can create two types of filters:

- **Basic filters**: Filters based on simple expressions
- **Advanced filters**: Filters based on complex expressions that combine multiple fields using the AND operator

1. In the **Filter** tab, select **New filter**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/sa-filters-select-new-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Filtering and sorting page, with the Filter tab and New filter highlighted.":::

1. In the **Create a new filter** pane, select the following options as required.

    - <a name="sa-basic-filter"></a>**For a basic filter**, enter the following information:

        | Parameter | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | Record | Select the type of record that you want to use to filter the work list. You can select only the record types that you added during the content and layout configuration when you set up the sales accelerator.<br>For more information, go to step 7 in [First-run set up](enable-configure-sales-accelerator.md#first-run-set-up).<br>The parameters **Field** and **Filter name** won't be active until you choose the record type. |
        | Field | Select the field that you want to use to filter the work list. The fields in the list are the basic attributes of the record type you selected. |
        | Filter name | Enter a name for the filter. By default, the name is *record type.field*; for example, **Lead.Currency**. |
        | Add filter to a group | Select a group to add the filter to. Grouping filters helps sellers to easily identify and apply them. If you don't select a group, the filter is added to the default **More filters** group. [Learn how to add groups](#add-groups). |

        :::image type="content" source="media/sa-filters-new-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the basic filter settings tab.":::

    - <a name="sa-advanced-filter"></a>**For an advanced filter**, select the **Advanced filter** tab and enter the following information:

## Configure work item appearance

The work list in the sales accelerator helps sellers to prioritize their time and effort. Customize work items to display the most relevant and important information in the work list. You can customize work items for each entity type that your sellers work with. [Learn how to customize the appearance of work items](customize-work-list-card.md).
