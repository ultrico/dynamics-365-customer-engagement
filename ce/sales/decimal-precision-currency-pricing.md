# Decimal precision in currency and pricing 

Decimal precision plays an important role in determining the number of decimal places to be used with field type **Currency** in Dynamics 365 Sales. It also affects rounding in calculations.

Decimal precision can be used at the following three levels:  

- **Pricing decimal precision.** This is an organization-level setting used for pricing precisions.  
- **Currency precision.** This option applies the precision defined for the currency in the record.  
- **Field-level precision.** This is used to define a specific set precision using values between 0 and 4.  

These precision levels are set while configuring currency fields. More information: [Create and edit fields for Microsoft Dataverse using Power Apps solution explorer](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/create-edit-field-solution-explorer)

## Pricing decimal precision 

This setting allows you to enable and set decimal precision for all supported price-related fields in the system. To configure the pricing decimal precision setting:  

1. In the sales app, go to **Settings** &gt; **Advanced Settings** &gt; **System** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **General**.  
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, you’ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).
    More information: [System Settings General tab](/power-platform/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-general-tab).

1. Under the **Set the currency precision that is used for pricing throughout the system**, select a value for **Pricing Decimal Precision**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The pricing decimal precision setting supports values between 0 and 4 only.

    This precision setting is applied to the relevant currency fields. By default, the following fields support pricing decimal precision:

    | Table | Field |
    |-------|-------|
    |Product| - List Price <br> - Standard Cost <br> - Current Cost|
    |Price List Item| - Amount <br> - Rounding Amount|
    |Opportunity Product, Quote Product, Order Product, and Invoice Product| Price Per Unit|

## Currency precision 

This option allows you to enable and set decimal precision to individual currencies. To configure the currency precision setting:

1. In the sales app, go to **Settings** &gt; **Advanced Settings** &gt; **Business** &gt; **Business Management** &gt; **Currencies**.  
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, you’ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

1. Open the currency record and enter the **Currency Precision** value. The value must be between 0 and 4.  
    More information: [Manage transactions with multiple currencies](/power-platform/admin/manage-transactions-with-multiple-currencies)

1. Save and close the settings.

    This precision setting is applied to the relevant currency fields. All currency fields except for the ones listed in the [Pricing decimal precision](#pricing-decimal-precision) section support currency precision.

## Field-level precision

This setting allows you to define the precision to individual currency fields. To apply this precision setting to any of the currency field in the system:

1. In the sales app, go to **Settings** &gt; **Advanced settings** &gt; **Customization** &gt; **Customizations** &gt; **Customize the system**.  

1. On the **PowerApps** home page, select **Tables** &gt; ***Table*** and then, select the currency field.
1. On the **Edit column** pane, select **Advanced options** and then configure the following values:
    - **Precision source** as **Precision property**.  
    - **Decimal places** as required and must be between 0 to 4.
1. Save and close the settings.
