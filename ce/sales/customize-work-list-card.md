# Customize the appearance of work items

The work list in sales accelerator helps sellers prioritize their time and effort. Customize work items to display the most relevant and important information in the work list. You can customize work items for each entity type that you or your sellers work with. Want to know how the work items appear by default? See the [Default work item appearance](#default-work-item-appearance) section. 

> [!NOTE]

>The card customizations made through the focused view will also affect the card display in the work list. More information: [Customize the work list card in focused view](focused-view.md#customize-the-work-list-card)
