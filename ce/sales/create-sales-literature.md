# Manage sales literature

Sales literature in [!INCLUDE[pn-dyn-365-sales](../includes/pn-dyn-365-sales.md)] stores sales-related information such as brochures or detailed specifications of products. Think of sales literature as a central repository for your organizationâ€™s sales information (in the form of sales attachments) that lets you share information with other users.

You can associate a sales literature to a competitor or a product.
