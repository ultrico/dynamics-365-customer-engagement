## Make calls with Teams

You can use Microsoft Teams to call a customer directly from the dialer, a record, or a work item in Dynamics 365.

> [!NOTE]
>- Verify that a valid phone number is associated with the Dynamics 365 records or work item.
>- After the call ends, a phone call activity is created and displayed on the timeline of the record and on the **Activities** page. 

**To call a customer through a Dynamics 365 record** 

1. Open a record. In this example, we're opening a contact record.

    In the **Business Phone** field, a phone number has been associated with the contact **Jim Glynn**.

1. Select ![Phone icon.](media/phone-icon.png "Phone icon") corresponding to the phone number. The call is established.

1. Select your conversation language from the language drop-down. Selecting the approrpirate language ensures accurate transcription, keyword tracking, analysis, insights, and KPIs.

1. Select the phone number of the customer from any of the phone number columns.
   :::image type="content" source="media/teams-dialer-call-from-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the All Accounts page with phone column highlighted.":::

    The Teams dialer opens and calls the number automatically.

**To call a customer from a work list item**

1. Go to **My Work** > **Sales accelerator**.

    Your work list opens. You can see the phone call activities that are pending for the day. In this example, the phone call activity for **Nancy Anderson** is pending for the day.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Open your work list.](media/teams-dialer-open-work-list.png "Open your work list")

1. Select ![Phone icon.](media/phone-icon.png "Phone icon") corresponding to the work item.

    The Teams dialer opens, and the call is established.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use the **Call** option in the **Up next** widget to make the call.

**To call a customer manually**

1. Open the Teams dialer.
1. Enter the phone number of the customer, or search for the customer through dialer search box.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Search for or call a phone number manually.](media/teams-dialer-call-number-manually.png "Search for or call a phone number manually")

1. Select **Call**.

## Receive Teams calls in Dynamics 365

You can receive calls in Dynamics 365 Sales. When a call is received, a notification is displayed in the upper-right corner of the page, as shown in the following image:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Call receiving notification in Teams.](media/teams-dialer-receive-call-notification.png "Call receiving notification in Teams")

The caller name is automatically displayed when the phone number is associated with a record. For example, Kenny Smith is a lead and has the mobile number +1 123 456 7890 associated with their record. When you receive a call from +1 123 456 7890, the name Kenny Smith is automatically displayed; you can select the name in the notification to open the record.

> [!NOTE]
> - If a phone number is associated with more than one record, the notification will display up to 3 records and will indicate more records exist with this phone number. Select the appropriate record.
> - If you receive a call while you're on another call, the inbound call notification will provide an option to either end the current call and accept the incoming call, or to reject the incoming call and continue with the current call.

To receive the call, select **Answer**. The Teams telephony panel opens and the call is connected.

A phone call activity is created and displayed on the timeline of the record. If the phone number is automatically resolved to a record, the **Call From** and **Regarding** fields of the phone call activity are automatically populated. If the received call isn't associated with any record, only a phone call activity is created. To associate the call with a record during the call, select the **Details** tab, and then select **Connect a record**.

## View missed calls in Dynamics 365

If you've missed a call, a notification is displayed in the in-app notification center in Dynamics 365. To view the missed call notification, select the Notifications icon (bell icon) in the upper-right corner of the page. If you've answered the call from another app, such as Teams desktop, the call isn't considered as missed.

> [!NOTE]
> Your administrator must have enabled and [set up the in-app notifications](configure-microsoft-teams-dialer.md#configure-the-dialer) for you to view the missed calls.
