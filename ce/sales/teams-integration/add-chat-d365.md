    By default, the message is added as a note. If you want to add the message as a task, select **Add as Task** in the upper-right corner of the window. The values from the **Regarding** and **Title** fields are populated in the task accordingly.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The message is added to the description field of the note or task. Rich text format is not supported for tasks. So, if you try to add rich text messages, you'll only see the chat URL in the description for tasks. You can manually copy and paste the chat message in such cases.

5.  Select **Save**.

    The note or task is added to the timeline of the record.

    By default, the note or task card is sent to the conversation. If you don't want to send the note or task card to the conversation, clear **Send note card to conversation** or **Send task card to conversation**.

6.  Select **Done**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/me-note-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat added as a note.":::

    The note or task is added to the record's timeline. A **View Chat** link is added to the note or task. Selecting the **View Chat** link opens the conversation in Teams.
