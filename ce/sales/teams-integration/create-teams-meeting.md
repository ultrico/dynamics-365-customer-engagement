## Overview

You can create a Teams meeting from Dynamics 365 or Microsoft Outlook. Link a Dynamics 365 record to the meeting to view record details before the meeting, in a side panel during the meeting, and after the meeting.

To link a Dynamics 365 record to a meeting, select a **Regarding** record while creating the meeting. When a record is linked to the meeting, the **Dynamics 365** app is added automatically to the meeting, and you can see the details of the linked record.

If a record isn't linked to the meeting, you can still add the **Dynamics 365** app to the meeting. Although you can add the app during the meeting, we recommend that you add it before the meeting starts for a better experience.

## Create Teams meetings in Dynamics 365

In Dynamics 365, you can create a Teams meeting from the **Timeline** of a record or from the **Activities** page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - For the join link to be created successfully, the user enabling the meeting for Teams needs to be the meeting organizer. The organizer field is not exposed by default on the appointment form but the value defaults to the user who creates the meeting.
> - The personal standards and formats selected by a user in Dynamics 365 affect the formatting of the Teams meeting details saved within the description of the meeting. To view the selected format, select **Settings** (:::image type="icon" source="../media/settings-icon.png" border="false":::) > **Personalization Settings**, and then select the **Formats** tab.
> - When you create a Teams meeting from Dynamics 365, the appointment status is set to **Free** and no reminders are sent to the participants.

### Create a Teams meeting from the Timeline

1. On the **Timeline**, select **Create a timeline record** > **Meeting**.
1. In the **Quick Create: Meeting** panel, enter the meeting information, such as attendees, location, time, and description.
1. Turn on **Teams meeting**.

1. Select **Save and Close**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a meeting from a record's Timeline, the record name automatically fills the **Regarding** field, creating the link between the record and the meeting.

### Create a Teams meeting from the Activities page

1. Sign in to your customer engagement app.
1. On the sitemap, select **Activities**.
1. On the command bar at the top, select **Meeting**.
1. On the **New Meeting** page, enter the meeting information, such as attendees, location, time, and description.
1. Turn on **Teams meeting**.
1. In the **Regarding** field, search for and select a record that the meeting is related to.
1. Select **Save & Close**.

## Create Teams meetings in Microsoft Outlook

If you create a Teams meeting in Outlook, it isn't linked to a Dynamics 365 record automatically. You must install the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to link the meeting to a Dynamics 365 record. After you install the app, open it and search for the record in the **Set Regarding** field.

For more information on creating a Teams meeting in Outlook, see [Schedule a Teams meeting from Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-teams-meeting-from-outlook-883cc15c-580f-441a-92ea-0992c00a9b0f).

For more information on using the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, see [Basic navigation in App for Outlook](/dynamics365/outlook-app/user/basic-navigation).
