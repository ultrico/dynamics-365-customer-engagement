## Overview

As an administrator, you can configure the ability for sellers to chat in Microsoft Teams from within the Sales Hub app and custom apps. This helps with effective collaboration on the sales records without having to leave the application.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams settings apply across all customer engagement apps. So, whether you enable the feature from Sales Hub or a custom app, it'll be enabled for all supported customer engagement apps.

When the feature is enabled, while working on sales records, sellers can start a new chat or connect an existing chat to a record, and thus collaborate efficiently without switching context or leaving the application. Connecting all the associated chats to a record can help sellers maintain all the chats related to the record in one place. You can also configure an optional introduction message that sellers can use to provide further context when collaborating on Teams.

## Enable or disable Teams chat

1. In the Sales Hub app, select **Change area** ![Icon to change the work area](media/change-area-icon.png) in the lower-left corner, and then select **App Settings**.

2. Under **General Settings**, select **Chat and collaborate**.

3. Turn on the toggle for **Turn on Microsoft Teams chats inside Dynamics 365**.

4. Select one of the following:

    - **Turn on for all Dynamics 365 apps** – Enables Teams chat for all supported Dynamics 365 apps in your organization, including any that you add in the future.
    - **Turn on for selected Dynamics 365 apps** – Enables Teams chat for the apps you choose. If your organization already uses Teams, the selection you made previously remains.

## Data security and privacy

The following data security and privacy considerations apply for Teams chat functionality in Dynamics 365:

- Dynamics 365 doesn't store any Teams data, except for the mapping between the record ID and the connected chat ID. No data from Teams is duplicated in Dynamics 365, unless the user manually adds it to the record notes or tasks.

- The communication between the applications is secured through TLS.

- Policies that apply both to Teams and Dynamics 365 are honored by the integration. For example, confidential files shared in a connected chat can only be accessed by permitted users. Similarly, a record shared in a Teams chat in Dynamics 365 can only be accessed if the user has permissions to view it.
