# Enable linking of Dynamics 365 records to Microsoft Teams channels 

By default, the linking of Dynamics 365 records to Teams channels is disabled for customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365:

- Dynamics 365 Sales
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Marketing
- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

> [!NOTE]
> - When the feature is enabled, the collaboration feature is [enabled only for a selected set of system entities](./teams-collaboration.md#record-types-that-support-microsoft-teams-integration). If you want to enable Microsoft Teams integration for additional entities or custom entities, you can only do it programmatically using the **msdyn_SetTeamsDocumentStatus** Web API action. More information: [Enable or disable Microsoft Teams Integration using code](../../customerengagement/on-premises/developer/integration-dev/teams-integration-using-code.md).
   > - If you run into any issues during configuration, see [Troubleshoot configuration issues with Teams integration](../../teams-integration/teams-troubleshoot.md#troubleshoot-configuration-issues-with-microsoft-teams-integration).

## Prerequisites

Microsoft Teams integration uses SharePoint integration at the backend. Make sure to meet the following prerequisites:

- If SharePoint integration isn't configured, OneDrive integration must be disabled too. If this requirement isn't met, you'll receive error code **800503ca** when you try to enable Teams integration with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365.

- If SharePoint integration isn't configured, there shouldn't be any active SharePoint site in your organization. (Deactivated SharePoint sites shouldn't cause a problem.) If this isn't met, you'll receive error code **800503ca** when you try to enable Teams integration with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365. 

- If SharePoint integration isn't configured, there shouldn't be any SharePoint document locations created with an absolute URL in your organization. Make sure to delete the locations with absolute URL. If this isn't met, you'll get error code **800503ca** when you try to enable Teams integration with customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365.

- If you're currently configured to use SharePoint on-premises for document management, you need to set up document management for a customer engagement app to use SharePoint Online. For more information, see [Set up apps in Dynamics 365 to use SharePoint Online](/power-platform/admin/set-up-dynamics-365-online-to-use-sharepoint-online).

- If SharePoint Online admin has enabled control access from unmanaged devices (conditional access policy) to allow/block SharePoint sites from unmanaged devices, then the same restrictions are applied for Microsoft Teams integration because Microsoft Teams uses SharePoint sites for document management. These restrictions might block users when they try to access a connected team channel file library on a customer engagement app page. For more information, see [Control access from unmanaged devices](/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices). 

- Enable SharePoint document management for the Dynamics 365 entities that you want to pin in Teams. For more information, see [Enable SharePoint document management for specific entities](/power-platform/admin/enable-sharepoint-document-management-specific-entities).

If you get an error while configuring Microsoft Teams integration from Dynamics 365, it might be because one or more of the above prerequisites aren't met. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Microsoft Teams integration](../../teams-integration/teams-troubleshoot.md#troubleshoot-configuration-issues-with-microsoft-teams-integration).

    > When you give your consent on behalf of your organization, the app gets full access to all Teams groups and associated content that the users have access to. Though the app has full access, it does not read or write to any of that data. The app just reads the teams/channels list or creates teams/channels for collaborating on Dynamics 365 data.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't select **Accept**, then when a user tries to pin an entity record or view to Microsoft Teams and shares the tab with another user, they'll receive the following error message: _"The admin has not consented to use user sync feature, you can add them manually."_ If you receive this error message, see [Error when you pin a record or view to Teams channel](../../teams-integration/teams-troubleshoot.md#error-when-you-pin-a-record-or-view-of-any-app-to-a-team-channel-if-your-user-role-permission-isnt-configured-correctly-by-your-customer-engagement-apps-system-admin).
