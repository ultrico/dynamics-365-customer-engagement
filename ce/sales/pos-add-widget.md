# Add the opportunity scoring widget to a form  

By default, the predictive opportunity scoring widget is available only in the out-of-the-box **Sales Insights** form. If you're using a customized form for opportunities, you can add the predictive opportunity scoring widget to it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You can add an opportunity scoring widget to a form only in Unified Interface apps.
> - You can't use the legacy form designer to add an opportunity scoring widget to a form.
