# Add the assistant widget to custom forms

By default, the assistant widget is available only in the out-of-the-box forms&mdash;contact, opportunity, lead, account, and case. If you're using customized forms, you can display the assistant widget on custom forms.

## Add the widget

>- The assistant widget can't be added by using the new experience in Power Apps.

1. In Dynamics 365 Sales Hub app and go to **Advanced settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu.](media/advanced-settings-option.png "Advanced Settings option on the Settings menu")

    The **Business Management** page opens.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Advanced Settings** page is moving from the web client to an Unified Interface app. If your organization has enabled the public preview of the **Advanced settings redirection** feature, youâ€™ll see the settings open in the Power Platform Environment Settings app. Find more information about the app and navigation path in [Advanced settings in the new experience](advanced-settings-new-experience.md).

2.  On the navigation bar, select **Settings**, and then select **Customizations**.

3.  On the **Customization** page, select **Customize the System**.

4. Under **Components**, expand *Entities*, and then the entity you want, and select **Forms**.

5. In the list of forms, select the form to which you want to add the assistant widget.

6. Go to the **Insert** tab and add a section with column to the form.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add a section with column to the form.](media/customization-add-section-with-column-form.png "Add a section with column to the form")

7. Select the added section and then on the tool bar, select **Assistant**.   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select assistant to add to the section.](media/customization-select-assistant-widget.png "Select assistant to add to the section")

    The assistant widget is added to the section.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![The assistant widget is added to the section.](media/customization-assistant-widget-added.png "The assistant widget is added to the section")

    >[!NOTE]
    >- When you add the widget to the form, the assistant icon in the tool bar becomes inactive and you can't add it to the same form.
    >- When you open the form and see that the assistant icon is inactive, specifies that the assistant widget is already added to the form. 

8. Save and publish the form.
