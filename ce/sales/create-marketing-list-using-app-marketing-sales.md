# Create a marketing list using in-app marketing

Your marketing list is the core of running a successful marketing campaign. It can include any one type of customer record, such as leads, accounts, or contacts.

You can create two types of marketing lists:

- **Static** Use a static list if you prefer to add and update members manually.
- **Dynamic** Use a dynamic marketing list if you want the list to return a list of members dynamically when needed, based on search criteria you set. For example, if you want to run a campaign to members of a specific city, use a dynamic list. A dynamic marketing list retrieves the updated list of members each time you open the list, create a quick campaign from the list, or distribute a campaign activity for a campaign associated with the list.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |
|------------------|---------------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | Any primary sales role, such as salesperson or sales manager<br>More information: [Primary sales roles](security-roles-for-sales.md#primary-sales-roles)|

2. Select **New**.
3. On the **Summary** tab, add the required information.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  To look up records in the **Owner** field, first select **Save**, or you'll lose your changes.

4. In the **Targeted at** field, select the type of record you want to include in the marketing list. You can't change this field after you save the record.

1. Select **Save** so you can enter information in other areas of the form.
1. Select the **Notes** tab to add any other information that applies to your marketing list.
1. Select **Save**.

## Manage members in a static marketing list

You can manage members in a static marketing list by using one of the following options:

- [Add using Lookup](#add-using-lookup)
- [Add using Advanced Find](#add-using-advanced-find)
- [Remove using Advanced Find](#remove-using-advanced-find)
- [Evaluate using Advanced Find](#evaluate-using-advanced-find)

> [!NOTE]
> - You can only add active records to a static marketing list.
> - To add more than 30,000 members to a static marketing list, you must either be a part of the Salesperson security role or higher, or have the **List Operation** permission.
> - :::image type="content" source="media/listoperation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Listoperation permission in the custom entities tab.":::
> -  When you add up to 30000 members to the marketing list, the add operation is performed synchronously. However, when the number of members exceeds 30000, the add operation is performed asynchronously in batches of 1000.
> - You can add up to 120,000 members to a static marketing list through a single Add operation. If you need to add more than 120,000 members to a static marketing list, split those members and perform multiple add operations. One way to do this is by using the [Advanced Find](#add-using-advanced-find) dialog to create queries that return less than 120,000 members. Alternatively, depending on your scenario, you can also consider using a dynamic marketing list instead of static list.

Functionalities will be affected.

The elements listed in the message are required to populate the members list that is included in the default form. If your custom form doesn't display the members list, you can ignore the message.
