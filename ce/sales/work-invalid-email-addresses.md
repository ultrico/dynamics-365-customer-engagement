# Work with invalid email addresses (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Email validation in Dynamics 365 Sales identifies and removes non-working or invalid email addresses in your leads and contacts. This proactive validation helps you prioritize customers who have a valid email address, which in turn results in lower email bounce rates, improved engagement, and increased value for your time.

As you enter the email address in the primary email field, the validation process starts automatically. If the email address is invalid, the envelope icon turns red and hover over the cursor on the envelop icon to view the reason for the invalidation. For more information on reasons for the invalidation, see [Understand email error message](#understand-email-error-messages).

Email address validation looks for the following errors:

- **Incorrect syntax**: An address that doesn't contain both a username and an email domain.  
- **Disposable domain**: An address that contains a known disposable or temporary email domain.  
- **Test or spam email addresses**: An address that contains known indicators of a test or spam address in the email header or metadata, IP address, HTML code of the email, and email content and formatting.  
- **Expired email addresses**: An email account that has expired and can no longer receive or send email.  
- **Emails that bounce back**: An address that can't receive a message for any reason.

## View invalid email addresses

You can view invalid email addresses on primary record or sales insights forms, work list items, and the **Up next** widget in sales accelerator. A red envelope icon indicates an invalid email address.

- **Primary entity and sales insights forms**:  
    Open a lead or contact record, and choose the primary record or sales insights form. In the following screenshot, a lead record has an invalid email address.

## Send an email to an invalid address

You can send a message to an email address that's marked as invalid. When you select the option to send email, a notification tells you the reason the email was marked as invalid. You can perform the following tasks in the notification:

- If you know the email address is valid, select **Mark valid**. The address is marked as valid and the alert is removed. Compose and send the email.  
- If you don't know the email address is valid but you still want to send an email, select **Compose anyway**. Compose and send the email.  
    :::image type="content" source="media/lead-email-validation-send-email-notification-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the notification that appears when you send email to an invalid address.":::

You can also send email to an invalid address by creating a manual email activity in the timeline.
