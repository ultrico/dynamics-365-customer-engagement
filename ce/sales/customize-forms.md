# Customize forms

In Dynamics 365 Sales, sellers use forms to interact with the data they need to do their work. It's important that the forms they use are designed to allow them to find or enter the information they need quickly. Use the form designer to customize the forms included with Dynamics 365 Sales to meet your sales organization's specific needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should only customize forms in the Sales app. Don't customize forms outside the app.

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Premium, Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise, or Dynamics 365 Sales Professional<br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |

## How do forms relate to entities?

A form is a set of fields, or table columns, that match the information your organization tracks for an entity. For example, your organization might have columns in an Orders table that track customers' orders and their requested reorder dates. In this example, Orders is the entity and OrderNumber, Quantity, and ReorderDate are fields in a form that sellers use to manage reorders.

When you publish a customized form, you're publishing an updated version of the entity that's associated with the form.

## What forms can you customize?

You can customize any of the following forms in Dynamics 365 Sales:

- Account
- Contact
- Invoice
- Lead
- Opportunity
- Quote

## Customize the forms

Select the appropriate tab for your license:

# [Sales Premium and Sales Enterprise](#tab/SE)
