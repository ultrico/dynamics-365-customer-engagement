## How does the sales accelerator help a sales team?

The sales accelerator is an engagement platform that helps a sales team understand customers' needs and respond in the following ways: 

- Engage with customers by using multiple channels within one workspace.
- Minimize the time spent on searching for the next best customer to reach out to.
- Gather information from multiple sources and let sellers focus on how to best approach their customers. 
- Sell smartly by building a strong and prioritized pipeline, offering context, and surfacing automated recommendations throughout a sales sequence that helps to expedite the sales process.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also set up the sales accelerator through quick setup (with the Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise license). In this case, you'll get 1,500 sequence-connected records per month. To set up sales accelerator through quick setup, go to the **Sales settings** page under **App Settings**. More information: [Set up sales accelerator](digital-selling-sales-accelerator.md#set-up-sales-accelerator)

## Recommendations

For the best experience of the sales accelerator, enable and configure [predictive lead scoring](configure-predictive-lead-scoring.md) and [predictive opportunity scoring](configure-predictive-opportunity-scoring.md) to display predictive scores for each record in the work list. Displaying the score helps your sellers to prioritize leads and opportunities based on how likely they're to be converted.

To experience the full capabilities of sales accelerator, purchase the Sales Premium license and configure the features such as sequences and segments. 

1. Sign in to your sales app, and in the lower-left corner of the page, go to **Change area** > **Sales Insights settings**.
1. Under **Sales accelerator**, select **Workspace**.

## Customizations

By default, the **Up next** widget is displayed on the **Default Main** and **Sales Insight** forms. To add the **Up next** widget to other forms, follow the process specified in [How do I add the Up next widget to an entity form?](faq-sales-accelerator.md)

[Learn more about how to add sales accelerator to the site map in your custom app](faq-sales-accelerator.md#how-do-i-add-the-sales-accelerator-site-map-to-my-custom-app).

## Add sales accelerator site map entry to custom app

>[!NOTE]
>Enable sales insights in your organization before you add the site map to your custom app.

When you create a custom model-driven app and choose a default solution to create a sitemap for the app. However, the list contains solutions that are based on entity forms only. The sales accelerator option is based on URL custom control forms and do not appear in the solution list. You must manually add the option to the sitemap. After you add these options, users in your organization can see them on the appâ€™s sitemap.  
Use the following URLs to add the sale accelerator site map to your custom app and perform the steps in [add site map entry to custom app](add-custom-site-map.md):

| Feature name      | URL                                                                                         |
