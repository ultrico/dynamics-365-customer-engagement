# Enable creation of orders from quotes

Quotes have important data about the customers and the products they're interested in. When you enable the creation of orders from quotes, it allows sellers to quickly create an order from a quote so that most of the details in the order are prefilled from the quote.  

## License and role requirements

| Requirement type | You must have |  
|-----------------------|---------|
| **License** | Dynamics 365 Sales Professional <br>More information: [Dynamics 365 Sales pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/sales/pricing/) |
| **Security roles** | System Administrator or Sales Professional Manager <br>  More information: [Predefined security roles for Sales](security-roles-for-sales.md)|

## Enable quote creation

1. Make sure you have a Sales Professional Manager or System Administrator role.

2. In the Sales Professional app site map, select **Sales Settings**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > This feature is not supported for Sales Enterprise and Sales Premium licenses and hence it's not available in the Sales Hub app.

3.  Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Quote Settings**.

4.  To enable creation of orders from quotes, set **Enable automatic quote to order generation** to **Enabled**.

7.  Open a quote, activate it, and verify if the **Create Order** option is available on the command bar. You can now select **Create Order** to create an order based on the quote.
