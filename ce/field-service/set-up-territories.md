# Territories for accounts, work orders, and resources

Territories help you divide your business into geographical regions for work order management, scheduling, and reporting. You can group customers, work orders, and resources based on a custom region.

Use territories with work orders and resources to help dispatchers schedule work orders to resources with a matching territory. Territories are useful filters on the schedule board, the schedule assistant, and the [Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in](rso-overview.md).

[Reporting](reports.md) by region is a common use-case for many organizations. Measure KPIs such as first-time fix rate, work order count by type, or work order invoice revenue by territory.

## Create a territory

Create your territories in Field Service settings or import them from Excel.

:::image type="content" source="media/territories.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of territories.":::
  
1. In **Field Service**, open the **Settings** area.

1. In the **General** section, select **Territories**.
  
1. Select **New** to create a territory record.

   - **Name**: Name of the territory.  
  
   - **Manager**: User who manages the territory.
  
   - **Description**: Enter information to include for this territory.

   - **Parent**: Choose a parent territory to define territory hierarchy.
  
1. Select **Save & Close**.  

## Assign resources to territories

Bookable resources like field technicians, equipment, or facilities can belong to one or more territories. Resources can be a part of multiple territories.
  
1. Open the **Resources** area. In the **Resource** section, select **Resources**.

1. Select the resource you want to assign to a territory.
  
1. On the Bookable Resource form, select **Related** > **Resource Territories**.

1. Select **New Resource Territory**.

1. Choose the **Territory** or create a new one.  

1. Select **Save & Close**.

## Add accounts to territories

Customer accounts can belong to a single service territory.

1. Open the **Service** area. In the **Customers** section, select **Accounts**.

1. Select the account you want to assign to a territory.
  
1. On the Account form, select **Related** > **Servicing**.

1. In the Service section, choose a Service Territory or create a new one.

1. Select **Save & Close**.

## Territories in the scheduling assistant

While scheduling, you can match the required service territory to the resources in those territories.

For example, when you assign a service account to a work order, the service territory of the account shows on the work order if the service account belongs to a service territory.

If you attempt to [book a work order with the schedule assistant](schedule-assistant.md), the **Service Territory** gets added as a filter. The listed resources will be part of that territory.

## Territories on the schedule board

Territories are also used on the schedule board to more effectively manage resources. For example, create schedule board tabs specific to a single territory that dispatcher manages.

On a new schedule board tab, add one or more territories as filters, and the resources shown adjust accordingly. Select **Save as Default** so the filters remain when you return later.

:::image type="content" source="media/territory-filter-schedule-board.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the schedule board, showing the territory tab.":::

To filter requirements by territories in the lower pane, select **Scheduler settings**. In **Board view settings**, set the **Apply territory filter to requirements** to **On**.

## Relate territories and postal codes

You can relate territories to postal codes. When the postal code is present on the account or work order address, the related territory is automatically filled in. For more information, go to [Create and manage postal codes](set-up-postal-codes.md).

## Advanced scenarios

- **Territories as more than location.** Organizations frequently use territories in combination with the purpose of the resource group. For example, if there are resources who operate in Seattle and some are responsible for maintenance and others inspection, the organization can create two territories: "Seattle - maintenance" and "Seattle - inspection." It's helpful if different dispatchers manage each territory because they can have separate schedule board tabs for each resource group.

- **Variable territories.** Sometimes resources belong to different territories during different time periods. For example, a resource covers a small territory during the day, but a larger territory at night when demand is low. Field Service doesn't support variably territories by default. However, you could use a workflow to add and remove a resource from a territory based on the time of day.

- **Resources crews and territory filters.** Resource crews show on the schedule board if the crew header resource matches the territory. All crew members show even if resource children aren't part of that territory. For more information, see the article on [enabling an entity for scheduling](resource-crews.md).

- **Using territories for non-field service scenarios.** Beyond field service, territories are useful in other scenarios. For example, salespeople assigned to sales territories that schedule time with leads, quotes, or opportunities. For this scenario, you can use a lookup to the service territory on the **Resource Requirement** form. For more information, go to [Enable an entity for scheduling](schedule-new-entity.md).
