# Buy a Dynamics 365 Field Service license

Purchase a Dynamics 365 Field Service subscription. To purchase licenses, you need a [Microsoft 365 administrator account](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-administration).
For the list of geographical regions supported in Field Service, see [Datacenter regions](/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions).

Try out Dynamics 365 Field Service before purchasing a subscription with [a free 30-day trial](trial-signup.md). You don't have to have administrator privileges to sign up for the trial.

## Available Field Service license types

There are two types of licenses for Field Service:

- The standard Dynamics 365 Field Service license that includes all core features and capabilities.
- The Dynamics 365 Field Service Contractor license that includes a subset of the core features and capabilities for third-party technicians.

For feature comparisons and pricing information, see [Field Service pricing](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/field-service/pricing/). For detailed licensing information, see [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

## Buy a Field Service license

1. Log into the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home) using your organization's admin account.

   If you can't access the Microsoft 365 admin center, contact your Dynamics 365 administrator.

1. Under **Subscriptions**, search for and buy Dynamics 365 Field Service licenses for each user.

## Field Service and mixed reality apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're releasing the updates to the Dynamics 365 Field Service licenses beginning December 1, 2023. Familiarize with the information until the changes are available in your region.

The Field Service license also includes Dynamics 365 Guides and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist at no extra cost. No action is required to assign the new licenses to existing users. However, the system doesn't install the applications automatically. For more information about installing the mixed reality apps, see [Collaborate in mixed reality with Field Service and Remote Assist](remote-assist-hololens.md) and [Integrate Guides with Field Service](mixed-reality-guides-integration.md).

The update automatically adds security roles for Guides and Remote Assist to users with predefined Field Service security roles. Admins can disable that setting to stop the automated role assignment for new users. For more information, see [Mixed Reality settings](configure-default-settings.md#mixed-reality-settings).
