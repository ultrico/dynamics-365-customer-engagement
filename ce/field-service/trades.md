# Use trades to group services

Trades let you group [incident types](configure-incident-types.md) in your preferred way. Configure trades and trade coverages to simplify the creation of [work orders](create-work-order.md) and the services that are provided in a functional location or for a service account, or for accounts at locations. Using trades adds another layer of details to create reports and filter charts on reports.

## Prerequisites

An administrator must enable [**Trades**](configure-default-settings.md#features-settings).

## Create trades

Before you can map incident types to a trade, an admin must define the trades that are available for your business.

1. Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Trades**.
1. Select **New**.
1. Choose the **Type** for the trade. Choosing *Coverage* defines the account or functional location that a trade covers. *Exclusion* removes trade coverage for the account or functional location.
1. **Name** the trade and **Save** it.

## Map trades to incident types

To group incident types by trade and create reports based on trades, an admin must configure the mapping. An incident type can map to one trade only.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Work Orders** > **Incident Types**.
1. Open the incident type record you want to map to a trade.
1. On the **Details** tab, choose the value in the **Trade** field.

## Configure trade coverages

Trade coverage defines which trades are covered for an account or a location to ensure the right level of service is provided. For example, if a location doesn’t have air conditioning, it shouldn’t be possible to create an incident related to the AC (air conditioning) system for that location. The same logic applies to accounts if the service contract doesn’t include HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) maintenance.

1. Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Trade coverages**.
1. Select **New**.
1. Choose a trade and select an account, a functional location, or both.
1. **Save** the trade coverage.

Alternatively, you can also show Trade Coverage as a related entity to your Accounts and configure trade coverage from there. That way you can see trade coverage with your service accounts and the trade coverage is automatically mapped to the right account.
