# Integrate Guides with Field Service

> [!TIP]

Integration with Dynamics 365 Guides lets Field Service users attach mixed reality guides to Field Service tasks. When work orders are assigned to technicians, the technicians can use a dedicated Field Service tab in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app to launch the guide and get their work done.

## Prerequisites

- Guides and Field Service are installed on the same environment.
- Guides users have access to the Field Service application.

## Using Dynamics 365 Guides with work orders

1. Create a guide using the Dynamics 365 Guides PC and HoloLens apps. For information on creating a guide, see:
  
   - [Use the PC authoring app to create a guide](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-app-overview)

   - [Use the HoloLens app to place your holograms](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/hololens-app-overview)

1. [Create a work order](create-work-order.md) in Field Service.

1. [Add a service task](set-up-service-task-types.md) to the work order. 

   1. In the **Service Tasks** view, select the **More Commands** button (...), and then select **Add New Work Order Service Task**.

   1. In the **New Work Order Service Task** view, select a task type, provide an optional description, and in the **Guides** field, select a guide to associate with the service task.

1. [Schedule the work order](schedule-work-order.md) to a resource.

After the technician signs in to the Dynamics 365 Guides app on HoloLens, they see the **Field Service** tab. This tab shows the guides, which relate to service tasks they're assigned to. There's also a short description of the booking and the work order.

The Guides HoloLens app shows work orders for the current day and the following eight days. Work orders appear in the HoloLens app until they're marked as **Complete** in Field Service or assigned to someone else.

## Known issues

- Long service task names are cut off in the HoloLens user interface.

- When assigning a guide to a Field Service service task, the system allows you to create a new guide. Don't use this option to create a new guide. Guides must be created using the Dynamics 365 Guides PC app or HoloLens app.
