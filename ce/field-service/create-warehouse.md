# Create a warehouse to track inventory

Track your product inventory by using a warehouse record in Dynamics 365 Field Service. After you create a warehouse record, add your product inventory to it.

## Create a warehouse record

1. In Field Service, select the **Inventory** area.
1. Under **Inventory**, select **Warehouses**.

1. In the **Active Warehouses** view, select **New**.
1. Provide a name for the warehouse, and assign an owner.
1. Select **Save** to create the record.

## Add product inventory to a warehouse record

Product inventory in a warehouse record is automatically adjusted through [inventory adjustment records](inventory-purchasing-returns-overview.md).

You can also manually add product inventory to a warehouse record. However, keep in mind that you can't modify the quantity values.

1. In a warehouse record, on the **Related** tab, select **Product Inventory**.
1. Select **New Product Inventory**.
1. Fill in the **Product** and **Unit** fields.
1. Optional: Fill in the **Bin** and **Row** fields to specify where the product resides in the warehouse.
1. Select **Save & Close**.
