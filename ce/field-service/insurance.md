# Create insurance policies

An insurance policy protects from financial loss in exchange for a fee. An insurance provider agrees to compensate the insurance holder in the event of a certain loss or damage. Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which a policy holder gets protection for a fee from an insurance company.

In Dynamics 365 Field Service, insurance is an entity that relates to accounts and defines the policy holder, insurance carrier, policy number, and the start/end date of the insurance contract.
