1. Select **Book** to create the appointment.

## Modify an appointment

You can change an appointment in the portal by choosing a new date and time or canceling it.

1. Choose a new date and time, and save your changes.
1. To cancel the service visit, select **Cancel appointment** and provide a note about the reason.

## View different states of the booking on the portal

### Traveling

Appointments in the **Traveling** state mean the technician is on their way to a service appointment. Appointments set to **Traveling** appear in the **Active appointment** section on the portal home page.

If [technician tracking is turned on](customer-portal-technician-tracking.md), the portal shows the technician's location on a map. To see the location, select **View Live Map**.

If multiple appointments are set to travel, only one appears in the **Active appointment**. The other active appointments are listed in the **Upcoming appointments** section, but you can select **View Live Map**.

> [!NOTE]
> Technicians must [share their location from the Field Service mobile app](mobile/track-technician-location.md) for location tracking and the estimated travel time. There's a small delay between their actual location and the location on the map. The delay can increase with limited network coverage of the technician's mobile device.

### In Progress

Appointments set to **In Progress** appear in the **Upcoming appointments** section of the portal home page. Appointments in progress can't be changed or canceled.

### Scheduled

Scheduled appointments are shown in the **Upcoming appointments** section. You can change or cancel scheduled appointments.

### Canceled or completed

Canceled and completed appointments move to the **Past appointments** tab. [Optional surveys](create-configure-customer-portal.md) to send feedback displays on completed appointments.
