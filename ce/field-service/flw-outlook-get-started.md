# Get started with Field Service in Outlook (frontline managers)

Dynamics 365 Field Service has an add-in for Outlook so frontline managers can manage their work orders. To get started using Field Service in Outlook, make sure the Field Service for Outlook add-in is installed, then sign-in and open the add-in.

## Install the Field Service for Outlook add-in

Your admin might have installed the add-in for your organization. If you see the Field Service icon in your email actions or **Field Service** in an email's **More actions** (**&hellip;**) menu, you can skip this step.

### Prerequisites

- You have either Outlook on the web or Outlook 2013 or later on Windows or macOS.
- You have a license for both Outlook and Dynamics 365 Field Service. If you don't have one, contact your organization's IT administrator.
- Your environment is in a [supported geography, region, and language](flw-overview.md#supported-geographies-regions-and-languages)
  > [!NOTE]
  > The supported language is based on your Outlook language. If you access Outlook from the web, the language is based on the web browser. If you access Outlook from Outlook Desktop, the language is based on Outlook Desktop's language.

### Install the Outlook Add-in

1. Go to [Microsoft AppSource](https://aka.ms/fieldserviceaddin) and select **Dynamics 365 Field Service for Outlook**.

## Get started with the add-in

1. Open an email or view it in the Reading Pane, select **More actions (...)**, and then select **Field Service**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you can't find the add-in, it may appear in a different location. See [Use an add-in in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-an-office-add-in-for-outlook-1ee261f9-49bf-4ba6-b3e2-2ba7bcab64c8).

1. Select **Get started**.

To make the Field Service add-in easier to get to in Outlook on the web, add it to your custom message actions:

1. Under **Message surface**, select **Field Service**.

1. Select **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> By default, the **Field Service** pane closes when you switch to a different email. To keep the pane open across all emails, select the **Pin** icon.
