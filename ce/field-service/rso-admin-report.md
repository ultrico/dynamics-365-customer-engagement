# Resource Scheduling Optimization admin report

The admin report in the Resource Scheduling Optimization Add-in analyzes when and how Resource Scheduling Optimization runs, but not the actual booking results.

[!INCLUDE[fs-report-workarounds](../includes/fs-report-workarounds.md)]

## Before you start

To run the report, the Resource Scheduling Optimization administrator needs to publish at least one [optimization schedule](rso-optimization-schedule.md).â€¯ 

## Filters and slicers

- **Schedule name**: Name of the [optimization schedule](rso-optimization-schedule.md).
- **Optimization request**: [List of jobs](rso-schedule-optimization.md#monitoring-optimization-requests) that ran to optimize schedules.

## Report metrics

To access the admin report, open **Resource Scheduling Optimization** and go to **Analytics** > **Reports**.
