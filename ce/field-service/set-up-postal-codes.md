# Create and manage postal codes

Create postal code records to automatically assign accounts to a [service territory](set-up-territories.md). Enter the address on the [account form](accounts.md) and the system automatically populates the service territory if the postal code matches.  
  
Postal codes relate to territories. However, they aren't required for the territories feature to work.
