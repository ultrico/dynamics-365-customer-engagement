# Dynamics 365 Field Service and SAP integration

Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service with SAP C/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA and connect your work order scheduling system to your enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

Microsoft offers guidance for integrating Field Service with the SAP Plant Maintenance and SAP Industry-Specific Utility (IS-U) modules. The integration is based on the [Common Data Model metadata system](/common-data-model/). Field Service is built on Common Data Model, similar to other Dynamics 365 applications.

Find more details in the [Microsoft Consulting Services GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MCSBusinessApplicationsDynamicsFSUtilityIndustry). The information is intended for independent software vendors (ISVs) and system integrators to improve and build upon as part of the Open Data Initiative.

The materials provide details on three main aspects of integrating Field Service with SAP:

- Field Service and SAP business processes
- Entity, field, and data models
- Guiding principles and best practices

The following diagram shows a sample architecture for how the SAP Industry-Specific Utility "meter to cash" solution could interact with Field Service.
