# Run Resource Scheduling Optimization as a simulation

Running an optimization as a simulation lets admins see what optimization results will look like. Review results closely before setting up a recurring schedule.

The simulation feature also empowers admins to review optimization results before pushing the assignments to all resources, or to discard the results and rerun by adjusting optimization parameters.

## How to trigger a simulation run

There are two ways to run an optimization request in simulation mode:

1. **From the schedule board**: Choose a schedule board with the custom web resource for Resource Scheduling Optimization configured. Select the **Optimization** options, set the optimization parameters and choose **Run as simulation**.

1. **From the optimization schedule**: Open the configuration of an optimization schedule and set **Run as simulation** to **Yes**. Publish the optimization schedule and run it.

After reviewing the results a simulation run, you can apply or discard the changes.
