# Search for resource availability and create bookings for requirement groups

Use the *Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group API* and the *Create Requirement Group Bookings API* to book the resources that meet the needs you identify in your requirement groups.

- The [Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group API](#search-resource-availability-for-requirement-group-api) returns available time slots for resources when you search by using requirement groups.
- The [Create Requirement Group Bookings API](#create-requirement-group-bookings-api) uses the available time slots for resources to generate booking records for your requirement groups.

You pass the details of a requirement group in your API calls and retrieve a list of available resources and their open time slots. This list is helpful for self-scheduling scenarios where a user wants to view the availability of resources, or for portal scheduling scenarios where a customer wants to view resource availability from a website or app.

At the time of writing, v1 is the latest version of msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup and supports web API calls.

## Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group API

Use the following input and output parameters for the Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group (**msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup**) API.

### Parameters

| Name  | Type | Required  | Description  |
|-----------------|---|---|---|
|Version | String | Yes |The version number of the API. The version number identifies the version of the API that should be invoked. The version number is a semantic version number of the format major.minor.patch. The request doesn't have to contain the complete version number.|
|RequirementGroup | | Yes | An entity reference to the requirement group entity.|
|RequirementSpecification |Integer| No | If left null, respects the targeting requirement group duration by default.|
|Settings |`Entity<InputSettings>` |No | Sets the settings for the request.|

### Input

| Name  | Type | Required  | Description  |
|-------|---|---|---|
| ConsiderSlotsWithLessThanRequiredDuration | Boolean | No | Specifies if a time slot with less than the required remaining duration should be considered when computing potential time slots. It's false by default. |
| ConsiderSlotsWithOverlappingBooking | Boolean | No | Specifies if time slots with overlapping bookings should be considered when computing potential time slots. It's false by default. 
| ConsiderSlotsWithProposedBooking | Boolean | No | Specifies if time slots with proposed bookings should be considered when computing potential time slots. It's false by default. |
| MaxResourceTravelRadius | Distance | No | Specifies the maximum travel radius for resources when computing available time slots. |
| SortOrder | Integer | No | Specifies the requirement group order for the response. |
| PageSize |Integer | No | Numbers of item returned in a page. It's 20 by default. |
| PagingCookie | String | No | Paging cookie retrieved from previous searching result.|
| OrganizationUnits |List&#60;Guid&#62; | No | A collection of organization unit IDs. A qualified resource must be a member of one of the specified organization units. |
| MustChooseFromResources |List&#60;Guid&#62; | No | Evaluate and select results from resources in this list. |
| RequiredResources |List&#60;Guid&#62; | No | Evaluate all resources, filter the results based on this list. In general, use MustChooseFromResources instead for improved performance. |

| ConsiderAppointments | Boolean | No | Set to True for search resource availability API to respect existing Dataverse appointments as bookings on the resource, provided the organization and resource level settings are set. Appointments with busy or completed statuses are considered as unavailable for scheduling operations. |
