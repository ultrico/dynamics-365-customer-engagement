# Create work order resolutions

Organizations often report on how work orders are resolved. This reporting increases visibility for customers and provides data for the system to provide resolution suggestions. Tracking how work is resolved can also help with training technicians on specific issues.

This article outlines how to create resolutions and associate them to incident types.

## Create resolutions

In Field Service, go to **Settings** > **Resolutions**.

Create resolution records based on your business needs. For example, if "Reset Device Control Unit" is a common way to resolve a work order issue, name the resolution accordingly. The description can contain additional information on why or how to reinstall firmware.

## Associate resolutions to incident types

Organizations using incident types to organize and track common work order issues can map resolutions to incident types. By default, the primary resolution maps to the primary work order incident type.

When administrators [configure incident types](configure-incident-types.md), they can [associate multiple resolutions to an incident type](configure-incident-types.md#add-incident-type-resolutions). When these incident types are added to work orders, the system creates work order incident types that suggest the associated resolutions.
