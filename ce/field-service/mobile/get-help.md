# Get help for the Field Service mobile app

Microsoft sends communications regarding service incidents, service changes, maintenance, releases, and customer action needed. Learn more: [Notifications for Business Application Group services](/power-platform/admin/notifications-explained).

- If you're looking for help with **errors, unexpected behavior, crashes, and bugs**, [create a support request](../field-service-get-help.md). Make sure you provide the session ID and version number of the mobile app. Sign in to the app, select your account picture, and select **Info** to get the session details and the app version.

- For help with **general inquiries, how-to questions, and best practices**, we invite you to [engage with the Dynamics 365 Community](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/?partialUrl=fieldservice).

- To submit and vote on **feature requests** and **product suggestions**, go to the [Dynamics 365 Application Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/categories/list/?category=b3d26f32-91b0-e811-a967-000d3a1bef07&forum=bee3d862-df65-e811-a95d-000d3a1be7ad).
