# Privacy note for Field Service push notifications

Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) licenses this supplement to you. You may use it with each validly licensed subscription of Microsoft Dynamics 365 services (the “online service”). You may not use the supplement if you don't have a license for the online service. The license terms for the online service apply to your use of this supplement. Microsoft provides support services for the supplement as described at https://support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx. This supplement enables authorized users to access the online service with the companion Field Service mobile applications for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (the “App”), which users need to install and license separately.

**IMPORTANT:**  By installing this supplement, **(1)** you consent to share addresses with an external system (Bing Maps) to locate addresses on a map and determine distance and travel time between locations, this supplement overrides your command on the admin System Settings to disable Bing Maps, consult Bing Maps technical documentation for more information; and **(2)** you consent to allow authorized users, accessing the online service, to instruct the App to:

1. Transmit addresses to the third-party mapping service provider designated by the Operating System on a mobile device.

2. Transmit your organization’s assigned ID and assigned end-user ID, and device ID to Microsoft to provide the services and verifying that the software is properly licensed.

Authorized users may instruct the App to access the online service at the time of installation of the supplement. The app only enables the listed functions. Disabling these functions must be accomplished by uninstalling the supplement. If you don't agree to these terms, don't install the supplement.

[Bing Maps end-user terms](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837) and the [Bing Maps Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) govern your use of Bing Maps. Service-specific end-user terms and privacy statements govern your use of third-party mapping services. You should carefully review these other end-user terms and privacy statements.

**IMPORTANT:**  If you use the supplement to enable Push Notifications on Field Service mobile applications for Microsoft Dynamics 365, you consent to transmission and sharing of your data to external systems. For more information, please refer to technical documentation for Field Service mobile applications for the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Push Notifications feature](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/field-service/mobile-push-notifications).

Also, service-specific terms and privacy statements govern your use of external, third-party push notification services to enable Push Notifications on Field Service mobile applications. You should carefully review these other terms and privacy statements.

Google Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification, and Windows Push Notification services don't run in a dedicated data center for exclusive use by you. They don't provide data segregation, such as for the Government Community Cloud. Your use of Google Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification, and Windows Push Notification services shall not be subject to any product-specific terms and conditions applicable to Dynamics 365 online for Government. If you don't wish to use the Push Notification, then you must ensure that your administrator keeps off the feature.
