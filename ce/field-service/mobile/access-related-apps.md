# Access related apps from the mobile app

The Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app provides quick access to IoT data and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist if your organization uses these capabilities. After enabling the new user experience, users can also [access a library of guides based on Dynamics 365 Guides](do-work-newux.md).

## IoT data

Field Service helps organizations embed IoT devices in their flow of work. Users of the mobile app find a subset of that information readily available. Live charts for IoT data from an IoT device, customer asset, or IoT alert record are available at your fingertips. Technicians can view and interact with IoT data and IoT actions like pulling live device data or registering new devices in the mobile app.
