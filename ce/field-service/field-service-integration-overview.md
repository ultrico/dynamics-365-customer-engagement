# Overview of Field Service integrations

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service integrates with your other business apps to streamline your field service operations and information management.

## Integrate with Microsoft 365 Outlook and Teams

With Microsoft 365 integrations for Field Service, frontline workers and managers can create, view, and manage work orders in Outlook and Teams. As an organization, you can use the capabilities of Field Service using Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Teams or both. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 integrations for Field Service](flw-overview.md).

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Business Central

Service organizations require a front-to-back application in which financials, inventory, and procurement are tightly coupled with service delivery. Field Service organizations generate financial data with every transaction of their system. Every work order represents cost and revenue. Every resource generates profit and loss. Every customer interaction adds entries on the general ledger. The integration between Dynamics 365 Business Central and Field Service greatly reduces the effort required to connect the two apps.

## Integrate with finance and operations applications (preview)

Seamless financial and inventory data flow between Dynamics 365 Field Service and Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management helps ensure the frontline and back office stay in sync. By syncing real-time price and cost information from work orders and automatically updating financial and inventory data as work orders are executed, this integration reduces the effort required to connect data between these Dynamics 365 apps.

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

Dynamics 365 Field Service includes basic inventory capabilities for managing frontline worker truck stock, tracking asset service history, requesting purchase orders, and documenting returns. Many organizations also integrate Field Service with their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. With an easy integration of Field Service with Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Dataverse, you can set up two-way sync for more comprehensive inventory tracking, resource planning, and asset management across systems.

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

If your organization is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, integrate it with Field Service to better support your frontline workers when they need to perform tricky procedures onsite. Technicians can start a mixed reality video call from the Field Service mobile app or their HoloLens to connect with a remote expert.

## Integrate with Dynamics 365 Guides

Integration with Dynamics 365 Guides lets you attach mixed reality guides to Field Service tasks. Frontline workers can launch the Guides HoloLens app and follow step-by-step holographic instructions to get their work done.

## Integrate with Microsoft Teams

With Teams integration, frontline workers can chat with team members in the context of their work orders to quickly get answers and troubleshoot issues. The chat history makes it easy to see which team members worked on a work order.

## Integrate with SAP

Integrate Dynamics 365 Field Service with SAP C-4Hana and SAP S-4Hana to connect your work order scheduling system to your ERP system and Dataverse. Microsoft offers guidance for integrating Field Service with the SAP Planned Maintenance and SAP Industry-Specific Utility (IS-U) modules.
