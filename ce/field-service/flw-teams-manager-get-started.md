# Get started with Field Service in Teams (frontline managers)

The Dynamics 365 Field Service app for Teams is designed to help frontline managers create and manage work orders. To get started using Field Service in Teams, install the app, sign in, and select your environment.

## Prerequisites

Your environment is in a [supported geography, region, and language](flw-overview.md#supported-geographies-regions-and-languages).

> [!NOTE]
> The supported language is based on your Teams' language. If you access Teams from the web, the language is based on the web browser. If you access Teams from Teams Desktop, the language is based on Teams Desktop's language.

## Install the Field Service Teams app

[!INCLUDE [fsp-deploy-teams](../includes/fsp-deploy-teams.md)]

## Select your environment

1. In Teams, select **Apps** and select **Field Service**.

1. Select the **Settings** tab.

1. Select your Field Service environment. If you work in more than one environment, you can easily [switch environments](flw-teams-manager.md#switch-environments) when you need to.
