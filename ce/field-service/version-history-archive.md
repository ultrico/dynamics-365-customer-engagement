- Added **Generate Actuals** toggle to Field Service settings which will allow organizations to disable actuals generation in Field Service. Additionally, when disabled, the time entry cost actuals generation field in Field Service settings is hidden since this setting becomes irrelevant.
- Improved Field Service health with additional rules.
- Applied performance improvements.

- Improved mobile offline filter handling for the time-off request table.

#### 8.8.31.60

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.32.1) 

- Improved error handling and messaging when the work order table is missing a booking setup metadata record. Previously, this scenario would throw a generic object reference error, which didn't help troubleshoot the issue.
- Enabled viewing related agreement booking incident records from a customer asset. Previously, this relationship wasn't visible from the customer asset.
- Improved conversion of an opportunity into a work order. The conversion from opportunity with opportunity products, now maintains the defined opportunity product’s **Sequence Number** as **Line Order** in the work order’s work order products.
- Corrected an issue with the agreement invoice setup’s invoice generation process, which could cause a generic error when the agreement invoice date tried to generate an invoice if the agreement invoice setup contained invoice products.
- Updated the solution to ensure that multi-resource work orders using requirement groups respect the resource preferences defined on the related service account for all requirements generated against the work order.
- Resolved an issue in a solution patch that inappropriately removed on-save handlers from the case table.
- Corrected an issue that caused any update of a work order product record to update the work order product’s **Exchange Rate**, even if there were no updated currency-related fields, after a change to related currency’s exchange rate value.
- Enhanced the logic on agreement booking date records that could cause unnecessary background processes to fire causing a momentary block from being able to update the related agreement booking setup. This logic improved to reduce the scenarios under which it would try to trigger this background process, removing scenarios where the agreement booking date’s **Booking Date** was update to a time further in the future. When this value pushes out further, the background process doesn't need to be triggered.
- Improved mobile offline filter handling for the warehouse table.
- Updated the Field Service Health rule name from “Waiting workflow instances owned by disabled user accounts” to “Waiting workflow instances owned by disabled users.”
- This release introduces the solution components for the improvements to the [Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management integration](./supply-chain-field-service-integration.md#purchase-orders) as [outlined for availability in Wave 2, 2020](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/integration-dynamics-365-supply-chain-management).

- Resolved an issue that had the potential to cause timeouts based on resource location updates from Field Service Mobile.
- Improved update logic to a work order product's currency field to ensure that non-currency related changes didn't appear as also making an update to the currency field.
- Corrected an issue: under certain circumstances, the system could autogenerate duplicate agreement booking date records when updating **Auto Generate Work Order**.
- Corrected behavior where it was possible to have the value of **Date Window Start** reverted on save if a user followed a specific record update pattern and got a form validation.
- Resolved an issue: if a user provided a name to a work order incident record that was different than the automatically provided value, then deactivated and reactivated the record, the name would revert to the automatic value.
- Resolved an issue that impacted certain solution update scenarios based on conflicting settings to the CanCreateAttributes attribute in the unit, unit group, and price list item entities.
- Improved form logic to allow for manual time entry record saving when an org has both Field Service and Project Operations installed.
- Improved the save/save and close behaviors of a record from within a modal form dialog (MFD) to ensure that the contextual record would automatically refresh so a user can see the immediate impacts of their efforts. An example scenario: a user creates a new booking from a work order, the booking form will now open in an MFD by default. When the user saves and closes the booking form, the contextual work order will refresh. The work order's status will change from "unscheduled" to "scheduled" immediately.
- Enabled the "Customer Asset Quick Create" and "Asset Work Order Quick View Form" forms to be customizable; initially, they were released as non-customizable.
- Corrected a problem that could present when bulk editing work order records.

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into early access and introduces the [Field Service 2020 Wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features) new and updated features.

In addition, this release includes the following changes:

- Resolved an issue with agreement invoice setups introduced during early access that caused an error in the primary invoice date and invoice generation process that could stop invoice generation from agreements.

#### 8.8.26.24

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.25.5) 

- Corrected an issue: under certain circumstances, the **Discount %** in work order product form is automatically cleared on save.
- Resolved an issue with agreement booking dates: when the booking dates are manually altered, the work orders weren't getting auto generated as expected relative to the **Generate Work Order Days in Advance** value of the related agreement booking setup.
- Improved handling for the sharing and unsharing behavior of the booking resource booking when the target user is disabled.
- When exchange rate on a currency is changed, any subsequent changes to a work order service record would result in the exchange rate for that record being updated. It should only be recalculated if a currency-related field is updated.
- Improved handling of the account’s merge functionality when one of the target accounts has a related Agreement where taxable is "No."
- Improved handling of the account’s merge functionality when one of the target accounts has a related RMA where taxable is "No."
- When using tab to navigate away from the **Estimate Total Amount** field on a work order service record after making an update, the system was inappropriately throwing the error "Enter an amount between $0.00 and $1,000,000,000.00."
- Corrected a bug: when the work order service’s **Line Status** was changed from "Estimated" to "Used," the **Estimated Discount %** field wasn't getting copied to the **Discount %**.

#### 8.8.29.226 (2020 Wave 2 early access update)

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.30.11)

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into early access and introduces the [Field Service 2020 Wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features) new and updated features.

In addition, this release includes the following changes that have the potential to change the existing system behavior or interface:

- Added quick create forms for all new asset properties-related entities to the Field Service model-driven app.
- Corrected an issue with a missing space in the "Field Service Activities" tab header for the account entity for the Field Service Mobile model-driven app.
- Improved the customer asset form to ensure that the IoT related tabs are displayed after the other form tabs.
- Removed the property logs option from the related menu from the customer asset form.
- Updated the property log display values to respect user settings for date and time.
- Corrected travel calculation logic for the Field Service Mobile model-driven app to ensure that, when the booking is set to in progress, if there was no **Estimated Travel Duration** the system will update the **Actual Arrival Time** and won't immediately increase total duration.

#### 8.8.29.165 (2020 Wave 2 early access)

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.29.5)

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into early access and introduces the [Field Service 2020 Wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features) new and updated features as outlined for availability in early access:

- Embedded Power BI Dashboard for key Field Service metrics
- Improved work order metrics
- Asset hierarchy and functional location
- Usability improvements for key Field Service subgrid as dialogs
- Enhanced skills-based matching in Resource Scheduling Optimization
- Predictive technician travel time
- Travel outside of working hours
- Enhanced work hours calendar for requirements
- Connected Field Service on the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app
- Field Service inspections
- Technician time tracking on Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile app
- Usability improvements for the field technician booking form
- Calendar view for booking work orders

In addition, this release includes the following changes that have the potential to change the existing system behavior or interface:

- Improved logic around agreement booking dates, which have a button to manually “Generate Work Order.” Previously, this button was available when a work order had already been generated. In this release, we improved the logic associated with this button to ensure this button wasn't available if the work order had already been generated.
- Corrected the display position of the map control in the “Location” tab for the work orders in the Field Service Mobile app’s default work order form. Previously, the map control appeared between the latitude and longitude fields. It now appears above these fields.
- When an incident type is applied to a work order, it results in the automatic creation of a work order incident, which can automatically create work order products, work order services, and work order service tasks. These records are associated to the work order and work order incident. If the primary incident customer asset field referenced a customer asset, all resulting records would also be related to the same customer asset. The release improves the logic for customer asset association on these records when a work order incident’s customer asset is updated. Previously, if the customer asset on a work order incident was updated, it wouldn't update the related work order products, work order services, or work order service tasks. It will now update these records appropriately, assuming the customer asset value of the child records matched the pre-change value of the work order incident.
- Corrected a poor system behavior: when updating a work order service record’s line status from “Estimated” to “Used,” the estimated discount percent value wasn't autopopulated into the discount percent field. This value will now autopopulate per the estimated value when the line is set to “Used.”
- Improved the error message on a purchase order receipt product when a user tries to change the quantity or unit after a related purchase order bill has been created.
- Improved display handling of the agreement and invoice subgrids on the account forms where a user may not have permissions to these related records. Previously, these subgrids would display with an error about the user’s permissions; however, now, these subgrids won't show on the form in such cases of insufficient permissions.
- Resolved an issue with the Field Service resource role’s permissions. Previously, this role was missing the “Append To” privilege on customer asset, which caused issues when trying to create customer assets.
- Improved the subgrid name for work order products on the default work order form for the Field Service Mobile app.
- Fixed an issue where the value for customer asset wasn't being copied into work order products, work order services, and work order service tasks that were created from agreement booking products, agreement booking services, and agreement booking service tasks that weren't related to an agreement booking incident. This association will now flow down, as expected.
- Added the "Field Service - Resource" role to the new app module for Field Service Mobile.
- Corrected some consistency issues with the labeling for “Work Hours Templates.”
- Adding a notification on agreement booking setups and agreement invoice setups to highlight that related work orders, invoices, and dates won't generate when users create or updates the agreement subrecords when the parent agreement’s System Status isn't active.
- Improved work order validation of the latitude and longitude fields to ensure that, if either value is populated, both values are populated, and that the values are valid.
- Improved warning messages on the booking form. It isn't advised to use a work order’s booking through more than one booking lifecycle. It should only go through the lifecycle once (scheduled -> traveling -> in-progress -> complete). Some organizations that reuse a single booking through more than one lifecycle began receiving a form notification that, while allowed, such practices aren't advised. This warning previously mentioned time entry generation anytime it was displayed; it will now only mention time entry generation when the environment is configured to autogenerate time entries to avoid confusion.
- Enhanced logic for work order service task naming if the work order service task was created from a work order incident as a result of the incident type’s incident service task. In such cases, if the incident service task has a name, the work order service task’s name will come from the incident service task; previously, the work order service task’s name was always the name of the related service task type. If the incident service task’s name is blank, the work order service task’s name will default to the service task type’s name.
- Removed unnecessary code that enforced that the booking and journal type fields on a booking journal would be editable under certain circumstances. These fields will now behave the way the rest of the fields on the booking journal behave.
- On the case entity, when Field Service is installed, there's a ribbon button to “Convert to WO.” Previously, this button was in an undiscoverable location. This button has been moved to be more discoverable.
- Improved Field Service Mobile’s user experience for tablet users to ensure proper column width, improved quick create experience, and improved subgrid usability on the booking’s Service tab.
- Changed behavior on the agreement booking service tasks. Previously, when changing the value of the related task type, the description field would always be cleared. Now it will only be cleared if the new value for task type has an overriding value; otherwise, the value won't be cleared by default.
- Updated the name for the “My Open Resource Bookings (Field Service Information)” view to simply “Bookings” for optimal use and display in Field Service Mobile.
- Removed some fields from the default configuration of the booking entity’s default form for the Service tab to improve usability of Field Service Mobile.
- Replaced the address control used in the Field Service Mobile forms for the account and work order entities with a new control optimized for mobile use.
- Enhanced the automatic copy logic for related resource preference records onto work orders created for the same account. Previously, when these records were copies, resource preferences of type “Must Choose From” on the account weren't being copied to the work order. They'll now be copied, as well.
- Improved usability of the booking’s service tab in Field Service Mobile to show five records in the subgrids, by default, instead of just two, as was the previous behavior.
- Minor improvement to tax calculation on the work order record to ensure that rounding rules resulted in a consistent value between the work order’s tax calculation and the invoice’s tax calculation. Under certain circumstances, previously, these values could be inconsistent by at the second decimal due to rounding differences.
- Updated the taxable field in Field Service Mobile forms for work order, work order service, and work order product to use a new toggle control for simplified mobile usability.
- Improved all default views for work order product, work order service, and work order service task to swap the Product, Service, and Task Type fields respectively with the Name field to improve default view usability.
- Enhanced validation on the agreement entity when setting the price list to ensure that the currency set on the price list is the same currency set on the related billing account. Previously, this validation wasn't present, which led to the potential for downstream errors on work order generation since the work order expects currency consistency between these two fields. Now, this validation is present at the agreement, ensuring agreement creation and update will protect downstream operations of the work order.
- Removed incorrect defaulting logic on creation of work order service, work order product, or work order service task records that weren't related to a work order incident. Previously, these records would be associated to the primary incident’s customer asset; however, they'll now be left blank by default as they aren't necessarily related to the primary incident’s customer asset.

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.24.5) 

- Includes all content from Field Service version 8.8.25.29

#### 8.8.25.29

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.24.4) 

- Corrected an issue on bookable resource booking forms where the **Estimated Arrival Time** field can appear as if it has been edited immediately after save (when it hasn’t been), making the form behave as if it had unsaved changes.
- Improved logic to allow for customizations to the work order form where the primary incident type is removed from the form to ensure that the out-of-the-box form logic has a null check for the **Primary Incident Type** field.
- Resolved an issue with missing localization strings on the IoT alert and IoT device entities, which could cause a script error.
- Fixed an issue on update of agreement booking incident, which produced an error if there was a related agreement booking service task with a null estimated duration.
- Resolved a problem with the agreement copy function that failed to copy agreements if there were deactivated agreement booking setup or agreement invoice setup records related to the agreement. The copy function will now successfully copy active records and ignore inactive records.
- Added a new Field Service health rule that will highlight agreement booking setup and agreement invoice setup records on which the latest workflow instance had failed which could keep expected work orders and invoices from being generated. Once detected, the rule also provides a button to resolve failed workflow instances.

- Fixed an issue with agreement update, which produced a "Nullable object must have a value" error on updating end date of an agreement whose end date is null.
- Removed the following BPFs from the Field Service Mobile app module: case to work order, lead to opportunity sales, opportunity sales, phone to case.
- Improved logic to allow for customizations on work order creation from an agreement if there are customizations in place to automatically create more resource requirement records.
- Improved Field Service’s missing form libraries rule in Solution Health Hub to improve the rule description.
- Enhanced logic to in the opportunity quick create form to respect scenarios when an environment sets the “Account” field as business required to ensure that Field Service form logic doesn't set the field as optional.

#### 8.8.23.85

(Includes Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.22.9)

- Improved crew booking validations, which ensure that the booked crew has at least one defined crew member for the date on which the booking is being created.
- Improved descriptions in upgrade scripts to make the script more comprehensible by an administrator by documenting deprecated upgrade script steps to minimize confusion.
- Fixed an issue that left the status null when created a new geofence, which could cause geofence events to not be created.
- Repaired a Field Service upgrade issue caused by a script that, when appropriate, created requirement group records. If the requirement group's name was too long, the script and upgrade would fail.
- Fixed an issue on the contact entity's geo code functionality that caused a script error if "Auto Geo-Code" was set to "No" in Field Service settings.
- Corrected an incorrect agreement booking setup recurrence validation error for "Too many days in month." Under certain circumstances, this error was thrown inappropriately.
- Resolved an issue with duplicate section and tab IDs in Connected Field Service that caused issues when trying to uninstall the solution.
- Corrected a null reference issue in Connected Field Service when loading the device summary control on the IoT alert form.

- Corrected scenario where msdyn_payment was null on payment details; this scenario was improperly throwing the following error "The payment amount can't be less than total amount applied to invoices."
- Fixed an issue where price list not changing based on changes to work order's billing account. For organizations experiencing this issue, a fix is available through the "Advanced Settings" field in the Field Service settings entity, to not introduce a potentially disruptive change at this time. Copy the following string into the hidden field:  

> *workorder.pricelist.usefrombillingaccount*

- Resolved an issue: the time-only control misinterpreted daylight savings time for certain timezones.
- Fixed an issue where form logic wasn't respecting environment configurations on the Lead entity. Customers can now set fields, like "Company," to be business required and the Field Service form logic will respect the setting.
- Corrected an issue on work order service: the "Total Amount" wasn't respecting the "Discount" when used in an editable grid.
- Removed the validation on bookable resource that required each bookable resource's name to be unique.
- Fixed an error on the quote booking product: under certain circumstances, the system would inaccurately throw the following error: "Enter an amount between $0.00 and $922,337,203,685,477.00."
- Fixed an issue on the work order quick create from account where the billing account didn't populate correctly.
- Improved customer asset lookup experience from work order incident to ensure the form respects when organizations define their own default lookup view.
- Resolved issue: in certain timezones, agreement booking setup's preferred start time wasn't appropriately setting on agreement booking dates' booking date and the  autocreated bookable resource booking based on the defined "Preferred Start Time."
- Fixed a scenario where, if an environment sets the default value of msdyn_linestatus to "Used," work order service creation would fail.
- Added a null reference check to correct an issue if work order service's "Duration to Bill" wasn't set.

#### 8.8.12.2

- Fixed an issue where the "Generate Work Order" button from advanced find on agreement booking dates wasn't displaying and working properly.
- "Due Date" field value on invoices generated from agreement invoice date is one day early. For organizations experiencing this issue, a fix is available through the "Advanced Settings" field in the Field Service settings entity. Copy the following string into the hidden field:  

> *autogeneration.usetimezone.invoiceduedate=true*

- Resolved a bug on deactivated work order service records throwing an error when reactivated, "Object Reference Not Set to Instance of an Object."
- Corrected an unhandled error in geocoding that failed if the address contained an extra comma.
- For organizations that would prefer that work orders generated from cases open in the same window, this action can now be controlled through "Advanced Settings" field in the Field Service settings entity. Copy the following string into the hidden field if you would prefer work orders to open in the same tab in the same window:  

> *casetoworkorderwindowbehavior=0*

>[!Note]
> The "Advanced Settings" field on Field Service settings is not added to the entity form by default.  

#### 8.8.11.19

**Available in all regions by April 2020**.

- Fixed an issue where agreement booking date generation fails when agreement is owned by a team.
- Resolved an issue where Field Service client-side logic fails when using contact form while in offline.

  - Work order and warehouse values don't autopopulate if the fields are removed from the form.
- When using quick create form for a work order from an account, fixed an issue where some of the fields that were expected to autopopulate weren't being populated.
- If the map control is removed from the work order form, it can't be added back. The control has been locked to the form so that it can't be removed from the form.
- Issue where the primary incident type record of a deactivated work order couldn't be deactivated; added a validation check to only allow the work order incident record to be deactivated when work order is deactivated.

#### 8.8.14.328 (2020 Wave 1 early access)

For more information about early access features, visit the [opt-in instructions](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates).

- Before a work order product or work order service is set to "Used," the total amount isn't calculated.
  - Previously, under some circumstances, a work order service line in estimated status could have a total amount value, despite not being set to used. This could result in challenges when looking at the work order's total amount and potential downstream invoice discrepancies.
  - This also required an improvement to the work order product and work order service views to ensure we show both the estimated total amount and the total amount so users could understand the value in context of the line's current status.
- On the agreement booking/invoice setup, booking and invoice generation time (respectively) could be incorrect if the user who owns the agreement is in a time zone +1 or higher from UTC.
  - Going forward, the system will consider the agreement booking/invoice setup owner's time zone when generating date records.
  - This will now mean that agreement booking date and agreement invoice dates will be generated correctly and consistently, relative to the owner's time zone.
  - Note: Be sure to validate that all existing agreement booking setups and agreement invoice setups owned by users +1 or greater than UTC are correctly configured to generate invoices and work orders per organizational expectations.
- On tax codes, when "Act As Tax Group" is "Yes," tax rate percentage and items taxable should be hidden.
  - When a tax code is configured to act as a tax group, the tax rate and items taxable should be hidden from the user as these values come from the applicable related tax code details for a tax group.
  - Further, on the tax code, when "Act as Tax Group" is "Yes," a form notification will now show on the form to highlight that tax code details are required for taxes to apply when you use the tax code.
- On the opportunity entity's main form, account shouldn't be mandatory if order type isn't "Service-Maintenance Based."
  - When creating an opportunity, the account field should only be mandatory if the order type is "Service-Maintenance Based."
- On the agreement booking/invoice setup, if a user's time zone was GMT +1 or higher, it autocalculated the default range of recurrence to one day before agreement start/end.
  - When defining an agreement booking/invoice setup as a user in a time zone +1 or higher from UTC, then the range of recurrence on the record's recurrence string was always one day before the start/end date of the related agreement's start/end date.
  - Will now calculate the default recurrence range appropriately based on the user creating the record's time zone.
- Deprecated quote booking setup's margin tab and calculation logic.
  - Formerly, on the quote booking setup form, there was a tab that attempted to calculate the margin of the proposed booking setup.
  - Under certain circumstances, this margin calculation could be incorrect.
  - Due to the limited usage of the feature and the complexity involved in supporting every permutation of possible configuration with corrected calculations, removed the tab and related calculation logic.
- Introduced better validation messaging if a user tries to increase the quantity on a quote line for service-based lines.
- Prevent agreement booking service task from saving when task type lookup field is null.
  - If an organization customized the agreement booking service task entity to make the task type optional, it resulted in downstream errors when trying to generate work order service tasks.
  - As such, registered a synchronous plugin that will prevent the creation of an agreement booking service task if task type is null.
- Fixed typo in error message when an incident type requirement group is related to an empty requirement group template.
- Prevent work order service from saving when the service lookup field is null.
  - If an organization customized the work order service entity to make the service optional, could result in downstream errors.
  - As such, registered a synchronous plugin that will prevent the creation of a work order service if service is null.
- Improved the warning notification message on the "Geo Code Address" button when you disable Bing Maps.

#### 8.8.10.44

**Available in all regions**.

- Agreement booking service task's name is overwritten when the related task type changes.
- Can't complete booking that has travel time if the travel charge type on the related work order's account is null.

#### 8.8.9.84

- Script error when you remove account field from the opportunity quick create form.
- On creation of account record based on postal code functionality, service territory repeats autopopulated, even after the customer removes the initial autopopulated value.
- Consistency issue in Field Service's Solution Health Hub rule naming when referring to SDK message processing steps.

#### 8.8.8.135

- Work order plugin error for SLA KPI instance.

#### 8.8.8.50

- Improve error messages when the user attempting an action is missing "Field Service Setting" read privilege.
- Form logic always turns incident type to not required based on work order type, regardless of field settings.
- Bookings aren't shared consistently to all resources on multi-booking work orders.
- Deleting and recreating a booking associated with a work order changes the shared users of booking.
- TypeError: Can't read property "getDefaultView" when requested by contact field removed from RMA form.
- Agreement invoice product currency set to base currency - the currency should set to agreement's price list currency.

#### 8.8.7.47

- Removal of territory from work order doesn't remove from non-primary related requirements.
- Inappropriate command buttons shown for opportunity, quote, and order product and service-based lines sub grids.
- Field Service resource privilege exception on create and save of time-off request.

- Fixed a bug: some customers were unable to reimport new custom solutions once they opted into the 2021 wave 2 early access and installed the updates. 
- Fixed non-blocking errors when updates were made to a booking record, like **Sequence contains no matching element**, and **Nullable object must have a value**.
- Fixed issue: Users couldn't drag the resource routes on the schedule board map to a nearby unscheduled requirement to create a booking. In the new schedule board, the user was required to select a resource before letting them drag the route. 
- Fixed issue: When using the new schedule assistant on a work order to book a resource, the work order title wasn't shown in the header of the schedule assistant experience. 

#### 3.12.50.27

(Includes Resource Scheduling controls version 1.1.7.211681)

- Fixed a bug where columns (fields) of type customer wouldn't filter based on the text typed, but show all records, when filtered in column filters on the requirement panel of the schedule board.
- When using the preferred resource on the requirement and quick scheduling is used, incorrect resources are shown with the heart icon for preferred resource. This issue is now fixed. 
- Fixed a bug where an error is thrown when booking end time and actual arrival time are same. This no longer throws an error, as it's a valid scenario for resources. 
- When a resource has time off for a few hours in a day, in the schedule board list view, there are two duplicate line entries for the same time off duration. This issue is now fixed, and should show as only one line item in the list view. 
- Pushed an improvement to the upgrade experience: when an organization deleted an out-of-the box shipped booking status record, the upgrade failed. This issue is now fixed. 
- Fixed an issue where users couldn't create a booking alert that they don't have read and write privileges to the booing alert status record type, even when the user has the necessary privileges but the team they're assigned to doesn't have the privileges. This bug is now fixed. 

#### 3.12.60.43 - 2021 wave 2 early access

(Includes Resource Scheduling controls version 1.2.0.212086)

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into the early access of 2021 wave 1 and introduces the [resource scheduling 2021 wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features#resource-scheduling) new and updated features. 

This release also includes the following changes that have the potential to change the existing system behavior or interface. 

- Performance improvements are made when applying the work hours templates to the resource(s). 
- Fixed a bug where the column headers and the columns were misaligned in the list view of the schedule board.
- The tooltip of the **Default radius unit** field of the schedule assistant under Resource Scheduling's scheduling parameter is corrected to **Choose the unit to display the distance on the Schedule assistant experience". 
- When we have the **Derive Capacity From Group Members** set to **Yes** in the **Scheduling Tab** of parent pool resource, any updates to a bookable resource group membership will trigger the deletion of all existing inner calendars of the parent resource and recreate them based on the child resource calendar. This recreation of the inner calendars happens even when we try to add a new child to the pool resource. This takes a lot of time, especially when the time period between the from and to dates is long. The longer the time period between from and to dates, the longer it takes to edit the bookable resource group and can cause the offline or timeout error after a certain threshold. Performance improvements are made by making the deletion of the inner calendars asynchronous. 

#### 3.12.49.18

(Includes Resource Scheduling controls version 1.1.7.211681)

This release is a hotfix on Universal Resource Scheduling version [3.12.46.21](/dynamics365/common-scheduler/bug-fixes#3124621)

- Fixed a bug where the schedule board doesn't load. 

#### 3.12.46.21

(Includes Resource Scheduling controls version 1.1.6.211322)

- **msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability** and **msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityforRequirementgroup** actions are now compatible with the web API endpoints. You could use the API parameter **version** = 3, to use this capability.
- Fixed a bug where columns (fields) of type **Customer** would show both account records and contact records when filtered in column filters on the requirement panel of the schedule board. 
- Improvements were made to the load time of the schedule assistant in the vertical view. 

#### 3.12.45.7

- Fixed an accessibility bug on the grid used in the requirement groups. At 400% zoom, content inside **Search** popup in **Preferred Resource** column isn't completely visible. With this fix, entire content that is visible at default view should be clearly visible at 400%. 
- Fixed a bug where a validation is done on the booking, that the **End time cannot be before or same as the estimated arrival time**, when the actual arrival time is already populated. With this fix, the validation would be that the **End time cannot be before or same as the actual arrival time**, as long as the actual arrival time is populated. 

#### 3.12.44.127

- When a booking alert is created in the context of the **SYSTEM** user, an error was thrown that the user doesn't have create privileges. This bug is now fixed.

- When schedule assistant is used on onsite requirements with fulfillment preferences of intervals, the end time of the suggested time slot on the list view is shown incorrect. This bug is now fixed. 
- msdyn_searchresourceavailability API returned same GUIDs for all the suggested timeslots when fulfillment preferences are used. This bug is now fixed. 
- In days, weeks, and months views of the schedule board, when new bookings are created or existing bookings are edited, a new visual spinner is shown to represent the progress of the operation. 
- When custom fields of the booking record are displayed on the booking template of the new schedule board, only the schema name of the custom field are displayed instead of the display name of the custom field. This bug is now fixed.

- Priority, territory and status lookup fields can now be filtered on the requirement panel of the new schedule board. 
- When the requirement map pins are hidden from showing on the map panel of the schedule board, the requirements were still retrieved in the backend. This bug is now fixed to remove the unnecessary call and improve the load time of the schedule board. 
- Due to different timezones used, the resource availability did not respect the business closure of the resource working hours. This bug is now fixed. 
- Fixed a bug where if user updates appointment series by adding required attendees, new bookings weren't created, when (legacy) appointment scheduling feature is enabled. 
- When quick book is used on requirement groups with multiple requirements with the field **Select** = **Any** option, then multiple combinations of same set of resources were shown in the suggested resources. This bug is now fixed. 
- When trying to filter the schedule board to specific resources, it doesn't filter anything out as **Retrieve Resource Query** field on the schedule board tab was pointing to an incorrect value. This bug is now fixed. 

#### 3.12.43.68 - 2021 wave 1 general availability

The following Universal Resource Scheduling 2020 Wave 1 features in general availability are included in this release.

- Map view, weekly, and monthly views in the new schedule board.

This release also includes all the fixes included in the [2021 wave 1 early access](/dynamics365/common-scheduler/bug-fixes#3124015---2021-wave-1-early-access) and [2021 wave 1 early access update 1](/dynamics365/common-scheduler/bug-fixes#312424---2021-wave-1-early-access-update-1).

- When creating multiday booking using **Evenly Distribute** booking method, user can't overbook resource with single booking if duration is greater than resource's availability during that time. This bug is now fixed. 
- Fixed a bug where quick scheduling is used on a requirement group with work location set to *Facility*, no available resources are returned. 
- Start and end time on schedule assistant list view mismatches with estimated arrival time and end time on the create resource booking panel when using fulfillment preferences (intervals) are used on aa *Onsite* requirement. This bug is now fixed. 
- **Rebook button** on requirement group’s bookings is using the **Default Booking Committed Status** from default **None** booking setup metadata, rather than using the default booking committed status from the schedulable entity’s booking setup metadata record. 
- **Clear Sorting** option is now available on the column filters of the requirement panel of the new schedule board. 
- When using quick book, the back button on the view resources page disappears if a different date is selected. This bug is now fixed. 
- Business closures aren't honored for the resource availability due to the different timezone on the resource work hours and the **User Timezone** preference. This bug is now fixed. 
- When a skill uses a special character like **&** in the name, the skill name is displayed as HTML-encoded in the schedule board filter layout. This bug is now fixed. 
- When using the schedule board’s email driving directions is fixed to send emails to the recipients in the **To** field. 
- When a business closure is created for a day in the Canberra time zone (GMT+10) and saved, the start and end times of the business closure were raised by an hour. This bug is now fixed. 
- Fixed a bug on the new schedule board in Hebrew, where the dates are incorrectly aligned from left to right when next day of the time range is selected. 
- Fixed a bug where schedule board displays text in Chinese on the date columns of the hourly view, when system language is set to Japanese. 
- When using the quick book, and the available resources are accessed on an available time slot, the time displayed is different than the actual time slot. This bug is now fixed. 
- When using a field where time zone information is displayed on the details panel of the schedule board, the field was incorrectly displayed as the time zone code, but not the actual time zone. This bug is now fixed. 
- When a requirement group record is opened from the schedule board requirement panel by double-clicking the record, it threw an error of insufficient privileges. This bug is now fixed. 
- Made an improvement to the date selection on the booking panel of the schedule board. If the start date is selected after the end date, then the end date should also be updated to the start date. If end date is selected before the start date, then the start date should be updated to the selected end date. 
- Unable to complete appointments without system admin security role privileges when customer service scheduling is installed. This bug is now fixed. 
- On the schedule board, we made an improvement to show the booking tooltips, when using the schedule board on a slower network (fast 3G speeds). 
- When a resource requirement record is created, a calendar record is created. When a resource requirement is deleted, additional logic is added to check if the calendar is used by any of the Dynamics 365 out-of-the-box record types, and if the calendar isn't used, then the calendar record is also deleted. A similar behavior is also put in place for the work hours templates. This deletion of the calendars improves the performance of the schedule assistant.

- Fixed a bug on the map view of the schedule board, where scheduled requirements with remaining duration equals 0 are still being shown as unscheduled requirement pin, leading to double requirements. With this fix, once a requirement is scheduled and Remaining duration equals 0, the pin won't be displayed as a requirement pin. 
- The days on the daily view of the schedule board are shown in right-to-left orientation for the right-to-left languages like Hebrew, Arabic. 
- Fixed a bug where a new requirement record is created, the status of the requirement record created isn't respecting the **Default Requirement Active State** value of the associated booking setup metadata record of the requirement. This bug is now fixed, and the default status of the newly created Requirement record will be based on the default requirement active status of the associated booking setup metadata record.
- When creating a booking for requirement groups using the quick scheduling feature, fixed a bug where the resulting errors (if any) weren't surfaced to the end user. Now if there are any errors during the creation of the Bookings, error message is displayed on the quick book interface.

- Fixed a bug where looking for available resources on the requirement groups, and **Least Busy** option on the schedule assistant is used, Resources returned weren't in the right order. This is fixed and only the least busy resources are returned on the top. 
- When preferred resource of resource preferences is used on the resource requirement record, the preferred resources aren't returned on the top of the recommended resources using quick scheduling. This bug is fixed, and the preferred resources are returned on the top. 
- Fixed a bug on the schedule board maps view, where the date picker isn't displayed when number of days displayed on the board is greater than one. This is now fixed, and the map view will display the date picker to show the map data of a specific day. 
- On the new schedule board, fixed an issue, where a resource is marked as **Display on Schedule Board** as **No**, resource is still being shown on the schedule board.

#### 3.12.25.5

- On the daily view mode of the schedule assistant, when **Ignore Duration** advanced setting is selected, all eligible resources weren't returned regardless of their availability. This bug is now fixed in this update. 
- Fixed a bug where quick book is used on a requirement group, and resources work in a different time zone than the time zone of the calendar of the requirements in the group, only a part of the available time slots were returned. With the fix, all available time slots are returned in this scenario. 
- When searching for resources in the daily view of the schedule board: once the searched Resources are returned, bookings of the resources aren't returned on the center area, until the board is refreshed. This bug is now fixed in this update.
- When a default search radius unit of kilometers is used and no available resources are returned, the schedule assistant crashes. This bug is now fixed, and users can expand the filter panel, even when no resources were returned to change the filters on the filter pane. 
- When quick book is used on a work order with an associated requirement group, and a resource is booked, **Booking Status selected is invalid for Work Order** error is thrown. This issue is now fixed. 
- When looking for available resources on a service activity record and **Least Busy** sort is selected, no available resources were returned. This is now fixed on the schedule assistant. 
- Quick book honors the default resource search radius defined on the booking setup metadata record of the schedulable entity (for example, work order, case, resource requirement, and so on).
- When any changes are made to a booking (like moving the booking or reassigning the booking), the custom booking rules defined by the user would get triggered. But extending  existing booking wouldn't trigger the booking rule. This bug is now fixed. 
- When fulfillment preferences (intervals) are used with a requirement group, the start date of the schedule assistant filter pane is populated incorrectly, which is now fixed in the update. 
- Schedule board center-area grid is misaligned when browser zoom is changed to 80 percent or 110 percent on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers. With this fix, the misalignment of the grid is fixed. 
- Fixed a bug where a custom entity can't be enabled for scheduling, when the name of the entity has more than 100 characters. With this fix, any entity that has a name with more than 100 characters can also be enabled for scheduling. 

#### 3.12.30.11 - 2020 wave 2 early access update 1

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into early access and introduces the [resource scheduling 2020 wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features#scheduling) new and updated features.

In addition, this release includes the following changes that have the potential to change the existing system behavior or interface:

- When searching for resources in the daily view of the schedule board: Once the searched resources are returned, bookings of the resources aren't returned on the center area, until the board is refreshed. This bug is now fixed in this update.
- When different capacities are used for a resource before and after a break, (for example 11 AM to 12 PM, working with capacity is 1; 12 PM to 1 PM is a break, and 1 PM to 2 PM, working with capacity 2) then the break time is shown as working time on the schedule board. This bug is fixed in this update. 
- Fixed a bug where quick book is used on a requirement group, and resources work in a different time zone than the time zone of the calendar of the requirements in the group, only a part of the available time slots were returned. With the fix, all available time slots are returned in this scenario.
- Fixed a bug where the search time window of the resource requirement is greater than the time range displayed on the schedule board and schedule assistant, the resource booked hours capacity on the resource cell weren't displayed. The expand and collapse button next to the resource in daily, weekly, and monthly views were also not displayed.

#### 3.12.29.5 - 2020 wave 2 early access

The release is only applied when an environment is opted into early access and introduces the [resource scheduling 2020 wave 2](/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave2/service/dynamics365-field-service/planned-features#scheduling) new and updated features.

In addition, this release includes the following changes that have the potential to change the existing system behavior or interface:

- Fixed a bug where a booking rule is used and throws a custom notification on the schedule assistant’s **Create Resource Booking** pane, the **Booking created successfully** wasn't being displayed. Now with the fix, even when booking rules are defined, the booking creation success notification is displayed. 
- When a custom date format (for example, dd/mm/yyyy) is used, the booking tooltip's displayed start time and end time are displayed incorrectly. This bug is now fixed. 
- Use openWebResource API to open schedule assistant in the client-side tools like Unified Service Desk, so that no custom actions need to be called to open the schedule assistant. 
- For organizations using Japanese language, in the schedule board’s date picker control now shows the right string in Japanese for the months displayed. 
- For organizations using right-to-left languages like Arabic as their base language, the short weekday names are now displayed on the date picker of the schedule board. Also fixed tooltip positioning issue for different components of the schedule board. 
- Fixed navigation using keyboard tab key on the move bookings to a different Day dialog of the schedule board, to move the focus from the booking statuses picker to the ok button, after a booking status is selected. 
- When a requirement status record is used as a default requirement status in the booking setup metadata record of a schedulable entity, the deletion of the requirement status record won't be restricted. 
- On the schedule board, the fields on the booking tooltip with long strings were truncated. With this fix, the long strings are word wrapped into a new line. 
- When an open area is selected on the schedule board, a pane opens with a lookup for the resource requirement record. Fixed a bug where the default view on this lookup wasn't changeable. With this fix, the resource requirement view can be changed to any other active view of the resource requirement entity. 
- On the client extension entity form, the lookup field for the web resource is fixed to show all the WebResource lookup views for CSS, JavaScript, and RESX views. 
- Fixed a bug when requirement groups are used with the work orders; on the schedule assistant, the booking status drop-down on the **Create Resource Booking** pane shows not just the booking statuses of the work order, but also related to other entities. With this fix, the booking status drop-down now only shows the booking statuses of the work order. 
- When a resource requirement record and a bookable resource are selected on the schedule board, and the book button is selected, the **Create Resource Booking** pane opens up with the start and end dates populated based on the requirement selected. When the resource selection is changed, the selected start date and end date are being reset. This bug is now fixed. 
- Improved the tooltip description of the field **Actual Travel Duration** field on the scheduling tab of the bookable resource booking to **Shows the total travel duration. Calculated based on the difference between the Bookable Resource Booking's Start Time and Actual Arrival Time.**
- The edit button on the business closure ribbon is hidden, as this button had no action on the business closure records in the view. 
- Removed unnecessary debug console messages for the business closure entity views. 
- When a new business closure record is created, the duration field is calculated incorrectly by adding an additional day. This bug is now fixed, and the duration field is calculated based on the start time and end time selected. 
- When a requirement status record is created and saved, the requirement status lookup field is read-only, so that this value can't be changed once the record is saved.
- When a requirement has multiple booking records associated, and one of the booking’s resources isn't active, the deactivated resource is filtered, and the uncaught exception is handled. 
- Fixed a bug with the time slot selection on the create resource Booking pane. With this fix, when **Book Based on** setting is set to **Estimated Arrival**, and the user selects a suggested time in the schedule assistant, the time they select is populated as the estimated arrival time in the booking panel. When **Book based on** setting is set to **Start Time**, and the user selects a suggested time in the schedule assistant, the time they select is populated as the start time in the booing panel. 
- Added additional checks on the schedule board default settings to prevent schedule board crash with the **Object reference not set to an instance of an object** error. 
- Fixed a bug where the focus on the resource search control on the weekly view of the list view type of the schedule assistant is lost when typing the resource name.
- The custom date format is now supported on the quick book pane. 
- When a booking is created on the schedule board with duration of zero minutes, **Duration must be greater than 0 minutes** is displayed in English on non-English orgs. This bug is fixed, and the string is now localized.

#### 3.12.24.5

- Fixed a bug where the search time window of the resource requirement is greater than the time range displayed on the schedule board and schedule assistant, the resource booked hours capacity on the resource cell weren't displayed. The expand and collapse button next to the resource in daily, weekly, and monthly views were also not displayed.

#### 3.12.24.4

- When you enable any entity for scheduling (for example, case, lead, account), enable **Quick Book** feature on the **Booking Setup Metadata** record of this schedulable entity, and set **Disable Requirement Auto Creation for Bookings** to yes. The resource requirement records won't be generated post the creation of the booking record. 
- The bug where there are multiple pages of available resources suggested on the schedule assistant, only the resources in the first page set were shown and resources on higher pages weren't shown. This bug is fixed, and paging through to next pages, resources will be shown as expected.
- When there are multiple work hours are entered on the same day for a resource (for example, 8 AM to 3:30 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM), there was a bug where the resource work hours calendar was only showing work hours as 2 PM to 5 PM. With this fix, the calendar for the resource would show that the resource is working 8 AM to 5 PM. Also, the same should be reflected on the schedule board. 
- When a resource has working hours (for instance, 9 AM to 5 PM on a day) and has time off 12 PM to 1 PM, there's a bug where schedule board shows that the resource has no working hours on that day, though the time off is for only one hour. This bug is fixed, and with this fix, the resource should show as working from 9 AM to 12 PM and 1 PM to 5 PM on the schedule board. 
- When creating a resource requirement using a work hours template, performance improvements are made to reduce the time of creation for the resource requirement record. 
- When the resource work hours are entered by using non-recurrence patterns for a large number of days, and large number of resources (for instance, more than 2000 resources in the org), when looking for available resources, the schedule assistant takes almost 40 seconds to load resources. Performance improvements are pushed as part of this fix, where in this case, the schedule assistant loads faster (around five to ten seconds, largely based on the amount of data). 

#### 3.12.23.71

- The issue with the filtering on the lookup type fields on the schedule board's requirement panel is fixed. 
- When hovered on the bookings on the schedule board, the tooltip was shown instantly, which sometimes blocked the view or blocked using right-click on the bookings. This issue is now fixed by adding a hover delay. When hovered on the booking, tooltip is displayed with a delay.

#### 3.12.23.27

- The rendering issue for tooltips on bookings of the schedule board is now fixed, by making the tooltip scrollable when the height of the tooltip is larger than the browser size. The hyperlinks on the tooltip can also be selected to open them in a new browser window.
- The text **Hide default requirement panels** is now made visible on the schedule board tab settings under the **Requirement Panels** section, which was previously only partially visible.
- Fixed an issue where entering a comma on the filter control of the filter panel was clearing the input on the filter control. With the fix, the comma won't influence the autocomplete, which was causing issues for customers who have a comma in their filter options.
- If the work hours tab is renamed or removed from a custom bookable resource form, when you select the **Show work hours** button, an error is displayed: **The Work Hours tab has been renamed or removed from this form. Please update this form to include the Work Hours tab.** Update so that the work hours tab can be added back to the form.
- Fixed an issue on the **Create resource booking** panel on the schedule board. With the fix, the **Start Date** and **End Date** on the panel will always reflect the **From Date** and **To Date** of the requirement selected in the **Requirement Panel** at the bottom of the board.
- The map pins of the resource requirement records are loaded on the map view of the filter panel on the schedule board, based on the view that is defined on **Requirement Map Filter View** on schedule board settings. We fixed the issue where, if the view used here has no filters on the view definition, the map panel never completes loading. With this fix, the map panel would load, regardless of the filters on the view used.
- Fixed an issue where **Universal Resource Scheduling** is used as the scheduling engine; users who aren't system administrators were unable to complete the appointment records. With the fix, any user with privileges to complete the appointment record can mark the appointment as complete.

#### 3.12.22.9

- For organizations that have [schedule board preview enabled](https://aka.ms/scheduleboard), the schedule board preview can be accessed from **Field Service** application sitemap along with **Universal Resource Scheduling** application sitemap.
- Fixed an issue where booking tooltip blinks when the height of the tooltip is greater than the height of the visible center Gantt area, where bookings are displayed on the schedule board. With this fix, the tooltip wouldn't blink and the user would be able to select the hyperlinks on the tooltip to open the respective record in a new window.
- Fixed the issue where [intervals](/dynamics365/common-scheduler/fulfillment-preferences) functionality of fulfillment preferences wasn't working on the schedule assistant.
- Resolved the issue of duplicated time slots for the resources on the list view type of the days view of the schedule board.
- Multiple calls to retrieve data in the list view type of the days view are reduced to one call, in order to improve schedule board performance.
- Fixed the issue where available time slots of resources are displayed differently on schedule assistant and the quick scheduling pane for the schedulable entities that don't have an associated resource requirement record.
- The horizontal and vertical view types are now hidden from the requirement group's find availability or schedule assistant screen.
- Fixed the error **The start address and end address cannot be empty**, which is incorrectly thrown on the **Get Driving Directions** functionality on the schedule board, due to an uncaught exception.
- Advanced find on the business closures entity is now supported.
- When using the schedule assistant/find availability functionality, the available time slots should be shown in the same timezone of the requirement calendar; however, if a schedulable entity like case doesn't have a requirement record associated, then the results need to be shown in the timezone of the CRM user preference.
- The issue of resource name truncation in the days view of the schedule board is now fixed.
- Fixed the focus shifting issue on the schedule board, where focus is shifted to a previous booking in focus, when booking status of the bBooking assigned to a resource at the bottom of the resource list. With this fix, the focus would stay on the booking in context.
- Fixed a translation issue on requirement groups in Japanese, where the name of the requirement or subgroups changes from Japanese to English when the record is saved.
- Quick scheduling now supports and handles different date format styles like English (South Africa).  
- Fixed an issue with the **Allow Overlapping** functionality on the bookings. With this fix, when a booking is marked as **Allow Overlapping** set to yes, the schedule assistant (find availability) will show the above booking as an available time slot if the **Allow Overlapping** advanced setting on the filter view is selected.

#### 2.4.10.56

[Read a blog post about the bug fixes](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2019/05/01/release-notes-for-universal-resource-scheduling-version-2-4-10-56/).

#### 2.1

[Read a blog post about the bug fixes](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/2017/05/19/universal-resource-scheduling-solution-for-dynamics-365-update-6-1/).

## Resource Scheduling Optimization Add-in

### Earlier release waves

For release notes and version history of the current release wave, see [Resource Scheduling Optimization version history](field-service-version-history-resource-scheduling-optimization.md).

#### 3.4.0.495

This release is the same as 3.4.0.459, with a more efficient solution delivery mechanism.

#### 3.4.0.459

Bug fix: Addressed issue where resource schedules were incorrectly ignored when there's a booking overlapping with optimization range start or end time.

#### 3.4.0.254

- Bug fix: Addressed an issue with using the Optimization panel in [Single Resource Optimizations](/dynamics365/field-service/single-resource-optimization#run-after-making-changes-to-defaults)
- Behavior change: We're changing the behavior of how Resource Scheduling Optimization handles locks on bookings. Currently, if an optimization schedule is running, it might lock bookings, which prevents a user from being able to delete the booking via Schedule Board. The user would be required to manually unlock the booking before deleting it. With this release, a request to delete a booking by a schedule board user overrides any locking by Resource Scheduling Optimization.

#### 3.4.0.180

- Bug fix: Addressed issue where certain schedule requests fail due to a timeout, with the message *Resource Scheduling Optimization failed to create, update or delete some of the bookings due to a system error*.
- Bug fix: Addressed issue where certain schedule requests produced overlapping bookings when using locked resources or by requirement duration and book duration mismatch.
- Bug fix: Addressed issue where unpublished schedules would get inadvertently published after a platform update.

#### 3.4.0.72

- Fixed optimization request errors:
  - System failed to optimize some records. Inner error(s): The primal integer program model is infeasible or unbounded: optimization status = InfeasibleOrUnbounded.
  - System failed to optimize some records. Inner error(s): An exception was thrown while activating F1.RoutingEngine.PathSolver.PathSolver.

#### 3.4.0.8

- Resource Scheduling Optimization always honors locked bookings and no longer overlaps them.

#### 3.3.5.199

- Resource Scheduling Optimization no longer fails with constraint violations; it will continue while skipping over the identified resource(s) that have violations. For more information, go to [Booking lock options](booking-lock-options.md).
- Bug fix: Addressed issue where ResetRSO fails with timeout exception on UR28.

#### 3.3.3.12

- Bug fix: Addressed the problem of Resource Scheduling Optimization jobs getting stuck in the 'Optimizing' state, which happened due to long running write operations from Dynamics 365 into Resource Scheduling Optimization.
- Bug fix: Adjusted the degree of parallelism that Resource Scheduling Optimization was using, to write results back to Dynamics 365. This was done to prevent throttling, which could cause optimization request failures.

#### 3.3.2.4

- Bug fix: Addressed issue where the predicative travel info icon wasn't able to be selected and hovering caused formatting issues.
- Bug fix: Addressed issue where single resource optimization requests with no schedulable requirements are canceled with message: "This request was canceled as none of the selected resource requirements or bookings were valid."

#### 3.3.1.38

- Bug fix: Addressed issue that caused Resource Scheduling Optimization to delete bookings that were locked to resource and time, if the booking was the length of an entire shift. 
- Bug fix: Addressed issue that prevented Resource Scheduling Optimization from deleting bookings that needed to be deleted, if they weren't associated with a resource requirement record.

#### 3.3.0.115

- Improved predictive travel time user experience. Allows users to distinguish bookings that used predictive travel (and thus have more accurate travel time that includes historical traffic) from those that didn't.
- Fixed bug in which 401 error was thrown in creation of account and contact records after Field Service autoupdate. Error message: "The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized."
- Bug fix: Addressed issue in which “Something went wrong. Try reloading the page. If you still see this message, contact your administrator to file a support request" when trying to display booking tool tip view on the new schedule board. This would occur when hovering over any booking.

#### 3.2.3.3

-	Bug fix: Addressed issue where a hard and virtually locked booking that was out of scope would show up as a create operation in the optimization request booking tab. Optimization request bookings are created for virtually locked bookings if Resource Scheduling Optimization has something to change. If there's nothing to change, the record shouldn't be created. 

>[!NOTE]
> Virtually locked bookings are bookings created outside of the optimization scope.

-	Bug fix: reset would cause error: “Value can't be null.” When a reset does happen, the confusing error is no longer provided. Instead, it errors by either defaulting the effort level or raising a ```RSODataNotFound``` exception.  
-	Bug fix: reset all in Resource Scheduling Optimization **Schedules** tab wasn't properly deleting data within database.  
-	Bug fix: Addressed error issue "System.OutOfMemoryException: Array dimensions exceeded supported range.” This scenario would occur when a trying to optimize a large number of resource requirements (~50k). 
-	Fixed “Keyset doesn't exist” errors. This error was a transient issue that would fail the authentication from Azure to CRM.
-	Bug fix: within ineligibility graph in which an entire resource was incorrectly removed if other shifts associated with the resource were still eligible to be scheduled. 
-	Bug fix: optimization would run for more than one day without completing. This scenario would occur when 5000 resource requirements and 500 resources were scheduled to be optimized over 21 days. 
-	Bug fix: the settings panel within Resource Scheduling Optimization app displayed "properties" instead of "priorities."
-	Bug fix: optimization goal wasn't saving when the travel time calculation was updated.

#### 3.2.2.18

- Bug fix: optimization request fails with the message: “an item with the same key has already been added.” The scenario occurred when there was more than one booking with the same resource requirement. 
- Bug fix: version 3.0.190941 wouldn't upgrade to version 3.2.1.96 due to plugin name issues.  
- Bug fix: schedule assist would fail with the message: “The remote name couldn't be resolved: 'website20200924t163642zzvulvehb5hdn4.azurewebsites.net'”. The scenario occurred when schedule assist was unable to correctly provide options for the resource name, travel time, and arrival time for a suggested booking.  
- Bug fix: running reset all or reset selected on a schedule associated with heavy effort optimizations would time out.  
- Bug fix: in operation requests booking details tab where the operation reason was showing “---” for all records.

#### 3.2.1.71

- Resource scheduling optimization intelligence used to help dispatcher schedule multiple requirements in the schedule board. [Read about this update](work-with-schedule-board.md).
- Increased end-to-end overall optimization performance by 3-5%.  

#### 3.2.1.6

- Bug fix: scenario installing the Resource Scheduling Optimization analytics solution would remove the Resource Scheduling Optimization app module icon. 
- Allow resources to travel outside of working hours [Read about this update.](/dynamics365/field-service/rso-travel-outside-working-hours)
- Improved predictive travel time accuracy [Read about this update.](/dynamics365/field-service/rso-predictive-travel) 

#### 3.1.5.24

- Bug fix: scenario where the MoveUp button was hidden on the Resource Scheduling Optimization goal objective. 
- Made performance enhancements for single resource optimization scenarios.  

#### 3.1.4.1

- Bug fix: scenario where the Resource Scheduling Optimization package was imported regardless of minimum Universal Resource Scheduling version required, resulting in an import failure. The fix ensures that the user can't import the Resource Scheduling Optimization package if the minimum Universal Resource Scheduling version isn't met.  
- Bug fix: scenario where single resource optimization deleted valid bookings. This scenario occurred when the user attempted to trigger single resource optimization for a resource. The single resource optimization would then delete most of the valid and eligible bookings.  

#### 3.1.3.17

- Bug fix: where 'Created On' field in optimization panel of Resource Scheduling Optimization schedule board doesn't respect date format of user setting. 
- Bug fix: issue where optimization request status wasn't set correctly when Resource Scheduling Optimization is run as a simulation. 

#### 3.0.19316.2

- ConsiderTravelTime parameter for SA API msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability isn't working as expected. Use the following steps to understand the impact of this bug fix:
  - Create a resource requirement with four hours duration, and location set to **Onsite**. 
  - Create a resource A with four hours available hour on their calendar; make sure there are a few minutes travel time between the location between resource and requirement.
  - Use msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability with the ConsiderTravelTime parameter set to false, and to find availability for this requirement. Before this, no potential bookable slot was returned; now there's potential bookable slot returned from resource A since resource A has enough available hours.
- Resource scheduling optimization booking details: **Operation Details** field doesn't show message anymore if user is missing the Field Service - Administrator security role.
- Booking status form showing false scheduling method the first time Resource Scheduling Optimization is opened after initial setup.
- Bug fix: Fixed upgrade issue from Resource Scheduling Optimization v3.0.18341.1 to latest in-market version.
