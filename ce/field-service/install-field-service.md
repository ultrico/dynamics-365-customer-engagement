# Install Dynamics 365 Field Service

After purchasing licenses for Field Service, you have to [install the app on a Dataverse environment](/power-platform/admin/manage-apps#install-an-app). purchase a license for the product.

When you [get a free trial](trial-signup.md), the Field Service application installs automatically on a new environment. After purchasing a license, you can [change the environment type to a production environment](/power-platform/admin/switch-environment).

Once the installation is complete, the "Field Service" and "Field Service Mobile" apps appear in the list of apps when you sign in to your Dynamics 365 organization. You can find these apps by going to:

```https://[your-environment-URL].crm.dynamics.com/apps```
