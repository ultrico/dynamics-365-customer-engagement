# Create a work order type

Work order types in Dynamics 365 Field Service lets you categorize and build different types of work orders. For example, work orders for installation, preventative maintenance, or repair. They also help separate work order information into views, reports, and dashboards.  
  
1. In the Field Service application, change to the **Settings** area.

1. In the **Work Orders** section, select **Work Order Types**.  
  
1. On the **Active Work Order Types** view, select **New** to create a new one or select an existing work order type to change it.
  
1. Choose if an [incident type record](configure-incident-types.md) is required and if you want to [use a specific price list](create-price-list.md) for that work order type.

1. Confirm your changes with **Save & Close**.
