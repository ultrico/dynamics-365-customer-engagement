# Link Dynamics 365 records to Teams channels 

> [!NOTE]
> This capability is availability only in the new version of Teams.

Linking of Dynamics 365 records to Teams channels allows pinning of records and views in the Dynamics 365 model-driven app to Teams channels as well as integration of Dynamics 365 and Teams documents. When you turn on enhanced Teams integration, it allows pinning of records and views to a Teams channel directly from Dynamics 365 and suggests members that can be added. Enhanced Teams integration requires tenant admin permissions. To know more about the feature, go to [Enable linking of Dynamics 365 records to Teams channels ](../sales/teams-integration/enable-record-linking.md).
