# Work with Microsoft Teams chat in Dynamics 365

You can configure the ability for sellers and agents to chat in Microsoft Teams from within the customer engagement apps such as Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, and custom apps. This helps in effective collaboration on the sales records without having to leave the application. 

When Teams chat is enabled in Dynamics 365, you can also enable Teams chat sync to create a record in Dynamics 365 for each chat that is created in Teams.

## Enable or disable Microsoft Teams chat in Dynamics 365

You can configure the ability for sellers and agents to chat in Microsoft Teams from within the customer engagement apps such as Sales Hub, Customer Service Hub, and custom apps. This helps in effective collaboration on the sales records without having to leave the application.

When the feature is enabled, while working on Dynamics 365 records, sellers or agents can start a new chat or connect an existing chat to a record, and thus collaborate efficiently without switching context or leaving the application. Connecting all the associated chats to a record helps in maintaining all the chats related to the record in one place. You can also configure an optional introduction message that can be used to provide further context when collaborating on Teams.

For app specific information about the feature, select the appropriate link below:

You can enable Teams chat sync to enhance the Teams chat integration capability in Dynamics 365. Teams chat sync makes it easy for sellers and agents to find Teams chats related to a Dynamics 365 record. When you enable Teams chat sync, related Teams chats can be found within the [timeline](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control) and activities grids similar to other activities like emails, meetings, and phone calls. 

When Teams chat sync is enabled:
- New connected Teams chats are created as Teams chat activity records in Dynamics 365.
- Teams chat activity records appear within the timeline control.
- Changes to the chat in Teams sync to the corresponding Teams chat activity record in Dynamics 365. For details about what data syncs, go to [Sync of chat data from Teams to Dynamics 365](#sync-of-chat-data-from-teams-to-dynamics-365).
- When you connect a Teams chat to a Dynamics 365 record, a Teams app named Dataverse Chat Sync is installed in the chat. This app allows Microsoft Dataverse to be notified when the chat is updated.

> [!NOTE]
> - You can enable Teams chat sync only when Teams chat in Dynamics 365 is enabled.
> - Activities entities, including the Teams Chat activity, currently don't support an association to another activity entity. For example, a Teams Chat activity row cannot be associated (regarding) to another activity row such as a task or meeting activity. You can still create linked chats which are associated to activity entities such as emails, meetings, or tasks, but those linked chats will not be created as activity records which appear in the timeline.

### Enable Teams chat sync

You must be a global administrator (tenant administrator) to enable Teams chat sync.

1.	In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), select an environment.
2.	On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Teams integration settings**.
3.	On the **Microsoft Teams collaboration and chat** page, turn on **Sync Teams chat data with Dynamics 365 records**.
4. Save the changes.

The feature is now enabled for all the customer engagement apps.

### Sync of chat data from Teams to Dynamics 365

The following table lists the data that syncs from Teams chats to the corresponding Teams chat activity rows (records) in Dynamics 365:

|Teams chat|Teams chat activity in Dynamics 365|
|----------|-----------------------------------|
|The topic (subject) of the chat|The subject attribute in the Teams chat activity row.|
|The person who last updated the chat in Teams|The modifiedinteamsby attribute in the Teams chat activity row.|
|The date and time the chat was last updated by a user in Teams|The modifiedinteamson attribute in the Teams chat activity row.|
|Members of the chat|Each user in the chat has a reference in the [ActivityParty](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/activityparty-entity) table with a party type value of 12 (Chat Participant).|
|The unique identifier (ID) of the chat in Teams|The teamschatid attribute in the Teams chat activity row.|

Other data such as chat message text and shared files don't sync from Teams to Dynamics 365.

### When will changes not sync

A connected Teams chat won't sync changes if any of these conditions are true:

- The Teams chat was connected to a Dynamics 365 record before chat sync was enabled. Only newly connected chats sync changes. 
- The Teams chat activity record is no longer active. Like other activity records, Teams chat activities can be marked as completed which means they're no longer in an active state. Only chat activities that are in an active state will sync changes. 
- The Teams chat hasn't been updated in seven days. If a chat hasn't been updated in seven days, Microsoft Dataverse will no longer receive notifications when the chat is updated. This limit may change in the future.
