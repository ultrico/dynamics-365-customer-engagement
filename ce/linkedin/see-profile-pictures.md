# Enable the display of LinkedIn profile pictures for matched leads and contacts

For leads and contacts that are matched to a LinkedIn member profile, the system can show profile pictures from LinkedIn. 

1. In your app, select the **Settings** icon, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

    The **Business Management settings** page opens in a new browser tab.

1. Select **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.
1. Enable the **Daily profile picture updates** toggle and select **Save**.

    The system will now display profile pictures for matched leads and contacts.

To enable the display of profile image in the contact or lead form, you must enable **Sales Navigator CRM sync** in the LinkedIn Sales Navigator settings. For more information how to enable CRM sync, see [Integration between Sales Navigator and your CRM](https://www.linkedin.com/help/sales-navigator/answer/82207/integration-between-sales-navigator-and-your-crm-overview).  

If you are unable to see the profile picture in custom forms, perform the steps as defined in the [Unable to view photos on custom contact and lead forms](ts-linkedin-integration.md#unable-to-view-photos-on-custom-contact-and-lead-forms-in-unified-interface) section.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Only profile pictures for matched leads and contacts can be captured from LinkedIn.
> - The profile picture from LinkedIn for a matched contact or lead is only shown in the out-of-the-box Contact or Lead form in the apps built on Unified Interface.
