## Enable CRM sync and activity writeback

By enabling the CRM sync and activity writeback, the Sales Navigator matches the Accounts, Leads, and Contacts in Dynamics 365 Sales. The sync also allows you to see the data created in LinkedIn Sales Navigator from Dynamics 365 Sales, including InMails and Messages.

To enable the CRM sync and activity writeback, follow the process as defined in [CRM Sync & Activity Writeback for Dynamics 365](https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator-customer-hub/resources/ms-dynamics-sync-activity-writeback).

## Existing orgs that got updated with April 19 features

In the [April 19 release](/power-platform/admin/preview-october-2019-updates#when-will-the-2019-release-wave-2-features-be-enabled), we introduced changes to how the Sales Navigator controls are enabled. Here are a few things to consider if you don't plan to enable the integration:

- Three solutions related to the LinkedIn integration appear in the **All Solutions** view in **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Solutions**. Although these solutions are preinstalled, the functionality and data transfer between the two systems will be disabled unless you [enable LinkedIn Sales Navigator](#enable-linkedin-sales-navigator). Additionally, **CRM Sync** needs to be explicitly enabled on LinkedIn Sales Navigator Admin Settings page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![List of LinkedIn related solutions.](media/solution-list.png)

- System customizers will see the new LinkedIn controls in Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity form editors. However, the visibility for these controls is turned off by default and users won't be able to see them on forms unless the feature is enabled by a system administrator. Customizers can remove these controls from pages as they'd remove any control that they consider too distracting.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Visibility settings in tab properties.](media/visibility-settings.jpg)

- While using **Advanced Find**, users see the new entities introduced by these solutions (InMails, Messages, and Smart Links) even if the integration wasn't enabled. This is the intended behavior; users can ignore these entities if they aren't actively using LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
