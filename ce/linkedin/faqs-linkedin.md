The on-premises Microsoft Dynamics 2016 and above versions don't support CRM sync or related functionalities.

<a name="smart-links-activity-labelled-pointdrive"> </a>
**Why is a Smart Links activity labeled as PointDrive?**  

**Answer:**  
In the Dynamics 365 LinkedIn 3.x solution, only the PointDrive label is changed to Smart Links: the functionality remains the same. If you're using LinkedIn solution version 2.x, we recommend that your system administrator or customizer change the label manually by following these steps:

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 app.    
1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.  
1. From the **Entities** site map, select the **PointDrive Presentation Viewed** entity.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/faq-pointdrive-presentation-viewed-entity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of PointDrive Presentation Viewed entity view.":::  

1. For **Display Name** and **Plural Name**, enter **Smart Links Content Viewed**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/faq-change-name-smart-links-content-viewed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Change Display Name and Plural Name to Smart Links Content Viewed.":::

1. Save and publish the customizations.  
1. Browse to an entity record and verify that the Smart Links label appears on the timeline.

<a name="show-smart-links-activity-on-timeline"> </a>
**How can I show an activity (InMail, Message, or Smart Links) on the timeline?**  

**Answer:**  
If you've properly configured CRM sync and activity writeback, the activity will successfully write back from LinkedIn Sales Navigator to Dynamics 365 and appear on the timeline. If the activities don't appear on the timeline, follow these steps:  

1. Sign in to your Dynamics 365 app.  
1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.  
1. From the **Entities** site map, select the entity (Contact or Lead) and then the form for which you want to configure the timeline.  
1. On the entity form, on the **SOCIAL PANE** tab, select **Notes Properties**, and then select **Change Properties**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/faq-select-notes-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the Change Properties option for notes properties.":::

1. In the **Activities Tab Properties** window, under **Unified Interface Properties (New)** tab, select the **Activities** tab.  
1. In the **Filter By** section, select the following options:  
   - From the **Show these activities** list, select **Show selected**.
   - From the options, select the **Ctrl** key, and then select the activity.
