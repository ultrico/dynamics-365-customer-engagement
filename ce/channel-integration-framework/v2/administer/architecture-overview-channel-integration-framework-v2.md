**1 - Microsoft Dynamics 365**<br>
Power Platform environment where the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework app is present to create and manage the configurations required for a telephony channel to interact with the Dynamics 365 model-driven app.

**2 - Multisession apps**<br>
The Customer Service workspace and Omnichannel for Customer Service apps expose the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework panel to host the telephony channel.

**3 - Channel Integration Framework Adapter**<br>
The Channel Integration Framework Adapter enables the communication between Dynamics 365 model-driven app and the capabilities of the telephony channel.

**4 - Web-based Communication widget**<br>
The telephony channel is hosted in the widget that Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework provides. You can host your choice of telephony channel.

**5 - Telephony Channel Provider**<br>
The telephony channel is the service that you want to integrate and interact with Power Platform environment using the Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework. The capabilities of a channel are specific to the channel provider; Dynamics 365 Channel Integration Framework is agnostic on the working of the channel.
