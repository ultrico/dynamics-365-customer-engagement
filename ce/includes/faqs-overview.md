An AI system includes not only the technology but also the people who use it, the people whom it affects, and the environment in which it's deployed. Our Responsible AI FAQ articles are intended to help you understand how AI technology works, the choices that system owners and users can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment. You can use Responsible AI FAQ to better understand specific AI systems and features that Microsoft develops.

Responsible AI FAQ articles are part of a broader effort to put Microsoft AI principles into practice. To find out more, see [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).
