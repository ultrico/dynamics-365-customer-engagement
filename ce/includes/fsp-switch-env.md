If you have permissions to work in multiple environments, you can easily switch between them without having to sign out and sign in each time.

1. In the Field Service  app, select **Switch environments** on the **Signed in to Dynamics 365** tile in either the **Home** or **Settings** tabs. On a mobile device, select the **Settings** tab.

1. Select your Field Service environment.

1. After the environment is validated, select the **Home** tab to go to the Teams **Home** page or select **Open Viva Connections** to go to your Viva Connections dashboard.

Your dashboard might look different, depending on your role in the new environment. For example, if you're a frontline manager in one environment and a frontline worker in the environment you switched to, the new environment shows your frontline worker dashboard.
