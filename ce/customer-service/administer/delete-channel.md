# Delete a configured channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]


You can delete an instance of a configured channel or SMS number in scenarios such as when it isn't required, you don't want to receive messages on it, or the settings are corrupted.

## Delete a configured channel

You can delete a channel instance in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center app.

1. Select a messaging channel such as Facebook.

1. On the page toolbar, select **Delete**.

1. On the confirmation dialog that appears, confirm the deletion.

If you want to reconfigure your social channel or SMS number in the application, follow the channel-specific instructions.

## Delete a Facebook page

If you no longer want to receive messages on a Facebook page that you've configured for your Facebook channel in the application, you can go to the page and delete it.

1. In the Customer Service admin center site map, select **Channels** in **Customer Support**.

1. Go to **Accounts** > **Messaging accounts** > **Manage**.
1. From the **Accounts and channels** page, select the channel that you want to delete.
1. On the **Account settings** dialog, go to the **Facebook Pages** tab, and select the workstream for the channel.
