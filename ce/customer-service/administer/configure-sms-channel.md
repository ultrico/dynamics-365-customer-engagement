# Configure an SMS channel for Telesign

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!Important]
> The Telesign channel will be deprecated and removed from Omnichannel for Customer Service on October 8, 2024. After this date, you won't be able to use this channel, and this article will be removed. Learn more at [Deprecations in Customer Service](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md).

An SMS channel allows your organization to connect to customers by using text messages. After you configure an SMS channel, your customers can send text messages and connect with a customer service agent. This channel provides your customers with the flexibility to connect on their mobile devices when an internet connection isn't available to connect to a chat channel.

Agents can view incoming SMS requests on their dashboard and respond accordingly.

The tasks to add SMS support for Telesign are as follows:

1. Enable SMS channel in the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center application.

2. Register with Telesign and get your customer ID and API key, and purchase a phone number.

3. Add SMS support.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The maximum number of characters supported for sent and received messages is 1600.
> - To ensure that third-party SMS providers handle opt-out commands properly, you must configure your consent settings with the provider directly.
> - SMS is an asynchronous mode of communication. Agents can close the conversation and then work on them later. Ending the conversation will mark it as resolved. More information: [Understand conversation states](../use/oc-conversation-state.md)

## Prerequisite

Verify that you have permissions on the secure columns. More information: [Configure permissions to access secure columns.](../implement/add-users-assign-roles.md#configure-permissions-to-access-secure-columns)

## Enable SMS channel in your Dynamics 365 organization

You can enable the SMS channel from the Dynamics 365 admin center. For steps on enabling SMS in your organization, go to [provision channels](../implement/omnichannel-provision-license.md).


## Sign up for Telesign account

You can integrate an SMS channel in Customer Service with Telesign. This integration uses public APIs of Telesign to send and receive text messages. You must sign up for a TeleSign account to enable an SMS channel in your organization.

1. Go to [Telesign](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2127719) to sign up for a self-service account, and upgrade to standard or enterprise account for a complete integration. If you expect to send high volumes of SMS traffic, such as more than 100,000 messages per month, contact [Telesign support](mailto:support@telesign.com) to request an invoiced enterprise account.

2. Purchase support phone numbers through your Telesign account.

3. Get the customer ID and API key from your Telesign account. You need to provide the ID and key while setting up the SMS channel in  the admin app.

4. You receive a callback URL that must be sent to [Telesign support](mailto:support@telesign.com). This callback URL is specific to your organization and is available when you add SMS support for your organization. When you send an email to TeleSign support, include the callback URL, your customer ID, and enter the subject line as **Omnichannel for Customer Service callback URL update request**.

## Flow of data between the SMS channel and Telesign

### Incoming text messages

For an incoming text message sent by a customer to the support phone number, the system first sends the message to the Telesign service. Telesign then pushes the message to Customer Service using the callback URL. After this action, the message gets routed and associated to either a new or an existing conversation by the application.

### Outgoing text messages

For an outgoing message sent by an agent, the message is first sent to the Telesign service and then Telesign sends it to the customer. In addition to the text message, the application uses the APIs provided by Telesign to send the customer's phone number, support phone number (Telesign SenderID), and the TeleSign account information (CustomerID and the API Key) to the Telesign service.

### TeleSign API Key Validation

When you validate the API key while setting up the SMS channel, a call is made to Telesign to validate customer ID and the API key.
