# Set up a multilingual bot to use in voice channel

You can configure routing rules to route voice calls to appropriate agents based on the language that your customer has selected. A multilingual contact center helps you serve global customers who want to interact with your contact center in the language of their choice. You can also set up bots as the first contact who can handle such requests.

Use Bot Framework Composer in Copilot Studio to set up a bot for a multilingual contact center.

The process for setting up the multilingual bot in Copilot Studio is as follows:

1. Create a bot in Copilot Studio.

1. Create a topic in Bot Framework Composer.

1. Configure the greeting topic in Copilot Studio.

1. Configure the transfer to agent node by using the escalate topic.

1. Configure workstreams and queues.

1. Verify the multilingual bot.

> [!NOTE]
> The [new multilingual chatbots](/power-virtual-agents/multilingual) aren't currently supported in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Prerequisites

- You must install Bot Framework Composer locally on the computer that you'll use to configure the multilingual bot.
- Your bot must be registered in the Azure app registration page. Note the application ID. More information: [Create an app registration](/azure/digital-twins/how-to-create-app-registration-portal#create-the-registration)

## Create a bot in Copilot Studio

You'll create a bot in Copilot Studio by selecting the environment in which Omnichannel for Customer Service is configured. For detailed instructions, go to [Create a bot](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-first-bot).

For example, you can create a bot with the following details:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the bot, such as **Greeter bot**.
- **Language**: The primary language for the bot, such as **English (US)**.
- **Environment**: The environment where Omnichannel for Customer Service is configured, such as **contoso-printers**.

## Create a topic in Bot Framework Composer

1. In Copilot Studio, for the bot that you created, select **Topics** in the site map, and then in the **Topics** pane, select the dropdown arrow for **New topic**. A message appears stating that the application is trying to open Bot Framework Composer. For more information on how to navigate the Bot Framework Composer, see: [Tutorial: Create a weather bot with composer](/composer/tutorial-create-weather-bot).

1. Select **Open**, and on the **Import your bot to new project** dialog that appears, enter the following details:

   - **Name**: A name for the project, such as **Multilingual bot**.
   - **Location**: Select a folder on the computer.

1. In Bot Framework Composer, select **More commands** (...), select **Add a dialog**, and enter the following details:

   - **Name**: A name such as **PVA greeter dialog**.
   - **Description**: A brief description. 

1. In the site map, select **BeginDialog**, select the **Add** (+) node, and then select **Send a response**.

   1. In the **Bot responses** section, select the **Add** (+) node, and then select **Speech**.

   1. Select **Add alternative**, and then add the following text.

      `<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-AriaNeural"><lang xml:lang="en-US">Hello ${virtualagent.msdyn_CustomerName}. Welcome to contoso customer support.</lang></voice></speak>`

      > [!NOTE]
      > The ${virtualagent.msdyn_CustomerName} variable provides the customer name for authenticated customers only through record identification. More information: [Identify customers automatically](record-identification-rule.md)

   1. Select the **Add** (+) node in **BeginDialog**, point to **Ask a question**, and then select **Multi-choice**.

## Configure workstreams and queues

Use the information in the following articles to configure a voice workstream and a voice queue, and their routing rules.

- [Configure a workstream](create-workstreams.md)
- [Configure work classification](configure-work-classification.md)
- [Configure a queue](queues-omnichannel.md)
- [Configure assignment methods](configure-assignment-rules.md)

For example, ensure the following settings:

1. Configure three voice queues—one each for English, French, and Portuguese—and add the required agents.

1. Configure a voice workstream with English as the primary language, and French and Portuguese as additional languages.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/multilingual-workstream.png" alt-text="Workstream with multiple language options set.":::

1. In the route to queues rule set of the workstream, use **Conversation.CustomerLanguage** as the criteria to route the incoming call to different language queues based on the option that's selected by the customer.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/multilingual-route-to-queue-rules.png" alt-text="Route-to-queue rules for the multilingual contact center workstream":::

1. In the **Bot** area of the workstream, edit to add the Copilot Studio bot that you configured.

## Verify the multilingual bot

1. As a customer, call the number that's registered with the voice workstream.

1. When you're prompted with an interactive voice response (IVR) message, select a language. Verify that the bot routes the call to an agent who can speak with you in the language that you've selected.
