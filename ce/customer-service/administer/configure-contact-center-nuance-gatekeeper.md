Use the information in this article to configure the following settings by using an Azure administrator role:

- Conversation Conductor Service
- Omnichannel Event Grid Writer Service

## Configure Conversation Conductor service

The Conversation Conductor handles the audio stream required to support biometric authentication and fraud prevention capabilities. This service requires the Contributor role on the specific Azure Communication Services resource connected to the Power Platform environment.

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to **Azure Communication Services resource** > **Properties** > **Id**. Use the SubscriptionId and ACSResourceId that's connected to the Power Platform environment.

1. Create service principals in the Azure tenant by using the following PowerShell commands:
   - `Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionID>”`
   - `New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "c880d6fb-5c66-49ef-9cf5-e53e31900be5" -DisplayName "Conversation Conductor"`

1. Provide contributor access to the Conversation Conductor so it can answer calls on the Azure Communication Services resource. (Application id: c880d6fb-5c66-49ef-9cf5-e53e31900be5).

1. Go to **Communication Service** > **Select the specific ACS resource** > **Access Control** > **Add role** assignment, and then select **Conversation Conductor** app in **Contributor**.

## Configure Omnichannel Event Grid Writer service

Create a new Omnichannel Service Principal account to configure new Event Grid subscriptions for incoming call events to the Conversation Conductor Service. This service requires EventGrid EventSubscription Contributor privilege on the specific Azure Communication Services resource connected to the Power Platform environment.

1. Go to **Azure Communication Services resource** > **Properties** > **Id**. Use the SubscriptionId and ACSResourceId that's connected to the Power Platform environment.

1. Create the Service Principal for Omnichannel for Customer Service.
    - `Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionId>”`.
    - `New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "a950df6d-e658-48fc-b494-ec69d8d9731b" -DisplayName "Omnichannel EventGrid Writer App"`.

1. Provide access to the Omnichannel Event Grid Writer with the permission to configure Event Grid subscriptions on the Azure Communication Services resource.
   - `Connect-AzAccount -SubscriptionId "<SubscriptionId>”`.
   - `New-AzRoleAssignment -ApplicationId "a950df6d-e658-48fc-b494-ec69d8d9731b" -RoleDefinitionName "EventGrid EventSubscription Contributor" -Scope "<ACSResourceId>"`.
