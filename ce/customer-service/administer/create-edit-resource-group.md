# Create or change a resource group (Customer Service app)

Use resource groups to group users, facilities, and equipment as part of the selection rules for a service.

Resource Groups are referred as Resource Categories. Learn more in [Create and manage resource categories](resource-categories-service-scheduling.md).
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_settings_bus_management](../../includes/proc-settings-bus-management.md)]  
  
2.  Select **Resource Groups**.  
  
3.  On the Actions toolbar, select **New**.  
  
4.  In the **Resource Groups** form, enter the required information:  
  
    - **Name**  
  
         You must enter a name for the resource group. The application doesn't check that the name is unique.  
  
    - **Business Unit**  
  
         To locate and select a business unit, select the **Lookup** button ![Lookup button.](../media/crm-ua-lookup-v4.gif "Lookup button").  
  
    - **Description**  
  
         You can add a detailed description of this resource group, including the criteria that you used to determine which resources to add to the resource group.  
  
5.  Select **Save**.  
  
     After you save the record, **Resources** appears under **Common**.  
  
6.  Select **Resources**, and then on the Actions toolbar, select **Add Resources**.  
  
7.  In the **Look Up** dialog, select the users, facilities/equipment, teams, or other resource groups to add to this resource group.  
  
     Adding other resource groups to a resource group helps you manage large numbers of resources. For example, you could add the resource groups of "senior technicians" and "junior technicians" to a resource group of "technicians."  
  
8.  Select **OK** to add the selected resources to the resource group.  
  
9. Select **Save** or **Save and Close**.
