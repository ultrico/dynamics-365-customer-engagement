# Set up skills, create a rating model, and assign agents

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

As an administrator, to create skills, you need at least one skill type in the system. For example, to add **Spanish** as a skill, you need a skill type called **Language**. You must first create a skill type and then create skills.

## Create skill types

1. Sign in to the Dynamics 365 instance.

2. Select **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** > **Customizations** >  **Customize the system**.

3. Select **Option Sets** from the left pane.

4. Double-click the **Bookable Resource Characteristic Type** from the list. A new window opens.

5. Select the **Add** icon under the Options container.

6. Type a name for the Label field. For example, **Language**.

7. Select **Save** to save the skill type.

8. Create as many skill types as required.

9. Select **Publish** to publish the customization changes.

## Manage skill settings in skills hub

Skills hub in Customer Service admin center helps you seamlessly create and assign skills to your agents. Use the **Skills hub** page to create and edit, add and remove users to skills and manage their proficiency.

1. In Dynamics 365, go to Customer Service admin center.

1. In the site map, select **User management** under **Customer Support**.

1. Select **Manage** for **Skills hub**. The Skills hub page displays the skills, skill types, proficiency scales, and intelligent skill find models.

### Manage proficiency scales

Create or update proficiency scales that are used to rate agent proficiency in the assigned skills.

1. On the **Skills hub** page, select **Manage** in **Proficiency scale** area.

1. To create a proficiency scale, on the **Proficiency scale** dialog, select **Create**, and do the following:

   - **Scale name**: Enter a scale name.
   - **Minimum rating value**: Enter the minimum value.
   - **Maximum rating value**: Enter the maximum value.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can enter positive values only as minimum and maximum rating values.

   - **Level names**: Enter names for each rating value, such as average, good, and excellent.

1. Select Create.

If you'd created proficiency scales in the classic experience, you can update them in the classic experience only.

### Create skills in skills hub

1. On the **Skills hub** page, select **Manage** in the **Skills** area.

1. On the **Skills** page, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create Skill** dialog, select a skill type in the **Skill type** list, and then enter a name for it in **Skill name**.

1. To add the skill to users, in the **Users** section, select **Add**, and then select the users.

1. Select **Add selected users**.

1. To add proficiency, select the users who will be assigned the same proficiency, select **Update proficiency**, and select a value from the dropdown list. The proficiency value is assigned for the selected users.

1. Select **Create**. The skill is created and assigned to the selected users.

1. To update the users for a skill, select a skill, and on the **Edit Skill** dialog, perform the steps to add users and attach a proficiency value.

## Create skills using the classic experience

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, select **User management** in **Customer Support**.

1. For **Skills**, select **Manage**.

1. Select **New**.

1. Specify the following in the **New Skill** page.

    | Field | Description  | Example value |
    |-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
    | Name | Specify the name of the skill. | Spanish <br> **Note:** <br> The name must be unique. |
    | Type | Select a skill type from the dropdown list. | Language |
    | Description | Provide a description of the skill. | This record is used to define the skill level of the Spanish language. |

1. Select **Save**.

After you save, the **Users (Agents)** section appears. In this section, you add the agents and rating value. More information: [Assign agents to the skill](#assign-agents-to-skill)

### Rating value of skills

When you add a skill to an agent, you also need to rate the proficiency of the skill. This enables the system to do an exact or closest match against the requirement of a conversation and distribute the conversation accordingly. You can use the default rating model, edit it, or create a new one to match the needs of your organization.

You must provide the minimum and maximum rating value. Also, in the **Rating Values** section, you must create rating value text against each score between the minimum and maximum rating value. This text appears when you're updating an agent's skill and proficiency.

### Create a rating model

You can create rating models in the Customer Service admin center app.

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, select **Insights** in **Operations**.

1. In the **Skill-based routing** section, select **Manage**.

1. On the **Omnichannel Configuration** page, in the **Rating Model** section, select **New Rating Model**.

1. Specify the following in the **New Rating Model** page.

   | Tab | Field | Description | Example value  |
   |------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | General | Name | Specify a name for the rating model. | Language rating model |
   | General | Min Rating Value | Provide a minimum rating value. | 1 |
   | General | Max Rating Value | Provide a maximum rating value. | 10 |

1. Select **Save**. The **Rating Values** section appears.

1. Select **New Rating Value**. The **New Rating Value** page appears.

1. Specify the following.

   | Field | Description | Value  |
   |-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
   | Name | Specify a name for the rating value. | ★★★★★★★★★★ <br> **Note:** <br>This is an example value.|
   | Value | Provide a value. | 10 <br> **Note:** <br>This is an example value.|


1. Select **Save and Close** to save and add the rating value to the grid.

1. Select **New** to add other rating values and repeat steps 4 and 5.

1. Select **Save** to save the rating model changes.

### Recommended proficiency level

We recommend that you use a rating model with minimum value as 1 and maximum value as 10, and define the rating values accordingly.

For example:

| Rating value name | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| ★★★★★★★★★★| 10 star|
| ★★★★★★★★★ | 9 star|
| ★★★★★★★★ | 8 star|
| ★★★★★★★ | 7 star |
| ★★★★★★ | 6 star|
| ★★★★★ | 5 star|
| ★★★★ | 4 star|
| ★★★ | 3 star|
| ★★ | 2 star|
| ★ | 1 star|

### Add agents as bookable resource in the classic experience

Add the agents as a bookable resource so that you can assign skills to them. This task is required for classic experience only and not for the new skills hub experience.

1. Go to the users page in any of the administrator apps.

2. Select a user from the list and select the **Omnichannel** tab.

3. Select **New Bookable Resource** in the **Skills Configurations** section. The **New Bookable Resource** page appears.

4. Specify the name of the user in the **Name** field.

5. Select **Save**.

### Assign agents to skill

1. In the site map of Customer Service admin center, select User management under Customer support, and then select  **Manage** for **Skills**.
   
2. Select a skill from the list for which you want to assign the agents.

3. Select **New Bookable Resource Characteristic** in the **Users (Agents)** section. The **Quick Create: Bookable Resource Characteristic** pane appears.

4. Select an agent name for the **User (Agent)** field. Only the name of the agents who are added as Bookable Resources appears in the dropdown list.

5. Select a rating value from the list. The values that appear are based on the rating model and rating values that you created. More information: [Rating value of skills](#rating-value-of-skills).

6. Select **Save and Close**. The agent you added is displayed in the grid.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
    > ![Assign agents to skill.](../media/assign-user-skill.png "Assign agents to skill")

7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 to add more agents to the skill.

8. Select **Save**.

Alternatively, you can also add a skill to the user (agent). More information: [Manage users](users-user-profiles.md).
