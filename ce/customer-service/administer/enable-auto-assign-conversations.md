# Enable conversations to be assigned automatically

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is intended to help customer service managers or supervisors enhance their team's performance and improve customer satisfaction. This feature is not intended for use in making, and should not be used to make decisions that affect the employment of an employee or group of employees, including compensation, rewards, seniority, or other rights or entitlements. Customers are solely responsible for using Dynamics 365 Customer Service, this feature, and any associated feature or service in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to accessing individual employee analytics and monitoring, recording, and storing communications with end users. This also includes adequately notifying end users that their communications with agents may be monitored, recorded, or stored and, as required by applicable laws, obtaining consent from end users before using the feature with them. Customers are also encouraged to have a mechanism in place to inform their agents that their communications with end users may be monitored, recorded, or stored.

Some customer conversation requests, such as those coming from a Facebook channel or an SMS channel, might not need an immediate response because of a longer service-level agreement. For such requests, you can enable the auto-assign option in the notification templates. When an incoming notification appears, the conversation is assigned to the agent automatically, either instantly or after the timeout period elapses.

Perform the following steps:

1. In Customer Service admin center, in the site map, go to **Workspaces** under **Agent experience**.

2. Select **Manage** for **Notification templates**.

3. On the **Omnichannel Configuration** > **Omnichannel Configuration - Notifications** page, select the template for which you want to enable the incoming conversation to be assigned.

4. On the **General** tab of the ***<notification_name>* Notification Template**, set the toggle to **Yes** for **Auto-assign work items**. The label for **Accept Button** changes to **Open**, and the toggle for **Show Reject Button** is disabled.

5. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> - We recommend that you don't enable the auto-assign setting in consult notification templates.
> - Auto-assign isn't supported in Omnichannel for Customer Service on Unified Service Desk.


## Enable voice calls and chats to be accepted automatically

When an agent rejects an incoming conversation, it is routed back to the queue. This impacts customer SLAs, queue wait times, and customer satisfaction. To avoid such scenarios, a conversation can be automatically accepted by an agent, either instantly or after the timer elapses.

Perform the following steps to enable the incoming conversations to be assigned automatically:

1. In Customer Service admin center, in the site map, go to **Workspaces** under **Agent experience**.

2. Select **Manage** for **Notification templates**.

3. On the **Omnichannel Configuration** > **Omnichannel Configuration - Notifications** page, select the required template.

1. On the **General** tab of the ***<notification_name>* Notification Template**, set the toggle to **Yes** for **Auto-assign work items**, and then set the **Auto-accept voice/chat calls** toggle to **Yes**. The **Show Countdown** field is set to **Yes** and disabled.

5. Select **Save**.
