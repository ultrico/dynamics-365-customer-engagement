# Route records automatically using custom flow

[!INCLUDE[cc-use-with-omnichannel](../../includes/cc-use-with-omnichannel.md)]

## Set up custom flow to automatically route records

As an administrator, you can route records automatically using Power Automate. Set up a custom flow to automatically route records based on certain conditions, such as when a record is created or updated. Let's see how to set up a custom flow for the create condition.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, for all of the cases created from the user interface, the **Route Case** field is set to **No**. So, routing for these cases is not triggered. <br>
> For case records, an out-of-the-box trigger is shipped to route the cases automatically. The routing is based on the **Route Case** field value in the case record.
> When a case record is created, it is either routed or not routed based on the **Route Case** field value of **Yes** or **No**.

To enable automatic routing of records:

1. Sign in to Power Automate and select the environment for which you want to create the flow.

2. Select **My flows** on the site map, then select **New flow**. Under the **Build your own from blank** option, select **Automated cloud flow**.
    The **Build an automated cloud flow** dialog box appears.

3. Select **Skip**. A list of all connectors and triggers is displayed.

4. Select **Microsoft Dataverse**. In the corresponding list of triggers that appears, select **When a row is added, modified or deleted**.

5. Specify the following values for the **Change type**, **Table name**, and **Scope** fields.
 
    - **Change type**: Create
 
    - **Table name**: Email Messages

    - **Scope**: Organization

6. Select **New step**. The **Choose an operation** dialog appears.

7. Select **Perform an unbound action** from the **Actions** list. The **Perform an unbound action** dialog appears.

8. Enter **msdyn_ApplyRoutingRuleEntityRecord** in the **Action Name** field as a custom value.

9. In the **Target** field, enter the entity collection name and unique identifier of the record as follows:

    `<entity collection name>(unique identifier of the entity)`, such as **emails(Email Message)**

    To get the entity collection name for a particular entity:
    1. Open your browser and go to `https://<org_name>/api/data/v9.0/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<entityname>')`.
    For example: `https://contoso.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='email')`.
    1. Search for `LogicalCollectionName` to view the entity collection name for a particular entity. <br>
    For example: `"LogicalCollectionName":"emails"`.<br>
    Here, `emails` is the entity collection name.

10. Select **Save**.

Now, based on the flow that is defined, whenever a record, in this example, an email, is created, the flow applies the **msdyn_ApplyRoutingRuleEntityRecord** action to the record. Similarly, you can create a custom flow based on your business scenarios. 

You can also perform other actions in the flow, such as filtering out certain records that you don't want to route and performing data transformation.
