# View conversation and session forms

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

Your organization might have a classification where certain agents work in the contact center, which uses Omnichannel for Customer Service on the web and certain agents work in another contact center, which uses model-driven app such as Customer Service Hub. In this case, if you are an agent who works on the model-driven app, and you need to analyze the conversation request from Omnichannel for Customer Service, you can find the information through **Activities** in the model-driven app.

Select the plus icon in the application tab to view the site map and select **Activities**.

> ![Select activities in the site map to view the list of activity types.](../media/oceh-oc-activities.png "Select activities in the site map")

There'll be many activity types, and you need to look for **Conversation** and **Session** types.
