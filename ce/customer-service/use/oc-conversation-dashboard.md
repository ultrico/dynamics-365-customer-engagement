# Conversation dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]


The Conversation dashboard gives you a broad overview of the customer service experience in your organization. It uses AI to surface insights into the topics that generate the highest volume and the topics that are emerging with the fastest increase in volume.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Conversation dashboard in Omnichannel for Customer Service.](../media/oc-Conversation-dashboard.png "Conversation dashboard in Omnichannel for Customer Service")

The dashboard includes various charts with graphical views of your organization's key performance indicators (KPIs).

The charts for conversation volume drivers and emerging conversation volume by topic charts use natural language understanding to group support conversations as topics that are a collection of related conversations. These charts display the customer support topics that are generating the most volume and emerging topics that are increasing rapidly in volume, helping you identify areas for improvement that can have the greatest impact on support performance.

By default, the dashboard shows you the KPIs for the past month and for all channels, queues, and agents in your system. You can use the data filtering options to select data for specific time periods, channels, queues, agents, conversation status, and timezones.

> [!NOTE]
> If you switch to a different dashboard, the filter you specified will persist, and be applied to the data on all dashboards.
