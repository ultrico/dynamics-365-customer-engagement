# Bot dashboard


[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability](../../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](../../includes/cc-pva-rebrand.md)]

In the the application, you can integrate both Azure and Copilot Studio bots to perform tasks like starting a conversation with the customer, providing automated responses, and then transferring the conversation to a human agent, as required. The bot dashboard shows key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts that you can use to understand how bots are performing in a support organization. 

If your administrator has enabled **Add historical analytics for bots** in Customer Service admin center, then the dashboard displays the metrics, KPIs, and charts specific to the type of bots integrated with the application.

### Access the Bot dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-navigation](../../includes/cc-navigation.md)]

## Copilot Studio bot dashboard

The bot dashboard displays metrics specific to Copilot Studio bots only if Copilot Studio bots are integrated with Omnichannel for Customer Service and the **Add historical analytics for bots** checkbox in Customer Service admin center is enabled.

 ### Report details

The report summarizes KPIs for the specified time period and the percentage change over that period. These metrics are specific to Copilot Studio bots. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or agent.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/oc-bot-KPI.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Copilot Studio bot dashboard KPIs.":::

| KPI | Description |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Total bot conversations | The number of conversations initiated by the customer and engaged by a bot. |
| Bot escalation rate |  The percentage of bot sessions that were escalated by a bot to a human agent.  |
| Total bot sessions |  The total number of sessions within the specified time period. A bot session is defined as a conversation in which a bot is invoked. The bot can be invoked at the beginning, during, or end of a conversation. |
| Bot engagement rate |  The percentage of total sessions that are engaged sessions. An engaged session is a session in which a user-created topic (as opposed to a system topic) is triggered, or the session ends in escalation. Engaged sessions can have one of three outcomes: they're either resolved, escalated, or abandoned. |
| Bot resolution rate | The percentage of sessions that were closed by interacting with a bot out of all the sessions engaged by a bot. |
| Bot abandon rate  | The percentage of engaged sessions that are abandoned. An abandoned session is an engaged session that isn't resolved or escalated after one hour from the beginning of the session. |
| Bot CSAT | The graphical view of the average of customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores for sessions in which customers respond to an end-of-session request to take the survey. |

The following table shows the bot KPI chart metrics.

| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Total conversations | A graphical view of the total number of bot conversations with the number of escalated and deflected conversations over time. |
| Engagement over time | A graphical view of the number of engaged and unengaged sessions over time. An engaged session is a session in which a user-created topic is triggered or the session ends in escalation. |

## Bot drill-down view

In the **Metrics by bot** section, you can select a Copilot Studio bot to view the individual bot's performance on the bot drill-down view. Bot topics and their corresponding metrics are also displayed, giving supervisors further insights into individual topic performance. 

To access the drill-down view, select the bot that you're interested in, and then select **Detailed view**.

The application displays the key performance metrics and charts for the individual bot.

### Metrics by bot topic

The **Metrics by bot topic** section provides insights into the performance of individual bot topics and their key business metrics. The metrics give the supervisor an overview of which topics the bot was able to deflect or escalate. 

You can also select a topic and drill down into the individual topic performance and metrics. The topic-level metrics help supervisors further analyze how the bot is handling the topic.

The **Bot conversation metrics** section provides the topic transcripts, allowing supervisors to go through the bot's interactions for the topic and take corrective measures.

### View and improve bot topics

You can view and improve the performance of individual topics associated with a Copilot Studio bot by performing the following steps:

1. On the bot drill-down page, for a bot, select the topic to view the topic-specific metrics. 
   You can also view and download up to seven days of bot conversation transcript sessions from the past 30 days.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot of bot transcripts.](../media/oc-transcripts.png "Bot transcript") 

1. To edit the bot responses to a topic, select **Edit Power Virtual Agents** on the Topics metrics grid. This opens the corresponding Copilot Studio bot. You can modify both the topic name and trigger phrases, and for trigger phrases, you can add more.

The **bot** dashboard summarizes the KPIs for all the bots integrated with the application for the specified time period and percent change over a period. The application displays this view only if your administrator has disabled the **Add historical analytics for bots** checkbox in Customer Service admin center. You can filter these areas by duration, channel, queue, or agent.
