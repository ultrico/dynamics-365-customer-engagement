# View social profiles of contacts

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

The system creates a social profile for incoming requests from asynchronous channels. After a social profile is created for a conversation within a channel, later conversations are linked to the same social profile for the channel so that you can view all the related information in one place.

When a customer contacts the contact center for the first time, you must search and link the customer contact with the conversation manually for the social profile to be created in Dynamics 365. Subsequent conversations are automatically linked.

## How social profiles are linked with contacts

When a customer sends a message, a record is automatically created with the social profile for the channel by using the unique identifier for the customer.

With social profiles, you can do the following:

- [Automatically identify customers](../administer/record-identification-rule.md) on social channels
- Display the customer name or phone number with conversations and calls on the agent dashboard
- Send outbound messages

The social profiles are supported for the following channels.

| Channel            | Supported?                                                          | Visitor name|
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Apple Messages for Business | Yes                                                        | Visitor     |
| Facebook           | Yes                                                                 | User name |
| LINE               | Yes                                                                 | Display name |
| WeChat             | Yes                                                                 | Visitor |
| WhatsApp with Twilio          | Yes                                                                 | Phone number |
| WhatsApp through Azure Communication Services          | Yes                                                                 | Phone number |
| Custom messaging (Telegram) | Yes                                                        | User name |
