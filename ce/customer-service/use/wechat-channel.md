# Use a WeChat channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

> [!Important]
> The WeChat channel will be deprecated and removed from Omnichannel for Customer Service on October 8, 2024. After this date, you won't be able to use this channel, and this article will be removed. Learn more at [Deprecations in Customer Service](../implement/deprecations-customer-service.md).

## WeChat channel

When you sign in, your work items display on the agent dashboard. Learn more at [View agent dashboard and agent conversations](oc-agent-dashboard.md).

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your administrator configured a WeChat channel.

## Incoming WeChat chat notification

You receive a notification when a customer requests a conversation through WeChat. When you accept the WeChat chat request, a session is started and the communication panel displays, where you can exchange messages with the customer.
