# Search resource availability and create bookings for requirement groups

Use the Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group API and the Create Requirement Group Bookings API to book the resources that meet the needs you identify in your requirement groups. 

- The [Search Resource Availability for Requirement Group](#bkmk_sra_rg) API returns available time slots for resources when you search by using requirement groups.
- The [Create Requirement Group Bookings](#bkmk_crgb) API uses the available time slots for resources to generate booking records for your requirement groups.

You pass the details of a requirement group in your API calls and retrieve a list of available resources and their open time slots. This list is helpful for self-scheduling scenarios where a user wants to view the availability of resources, or for portal scheduling scenarios where a customer wants to view resource availability from a website or app.

### Prerequisites

- Dynamics 365 version 9.0 or above with Universal Resource Scheduling version 3.12.x.x

### Parameters

|  Name   | Type  | Required | Description   |
|-----------------|-----------------|---|---------|
|Version | String | Yes | The version number of the API. The version number identifies the version of the API that should be invoked. The version number is a semantic version number of the format major.minor.patch. The request doesn't have to contain the complete version number.|
|RequirementGroup | EntityReference  |Yes | An entity reference to the requirement group entity, usually is a GUID, as shown in the following sample.|
|Start |DateTime | Yes | Start time of the Timeslot. |
|Duration | Integer | Yes  | The Duration of the Booking to be created.|
|ResourceAssignments | EntityCollection | Yes| It's an entity collection of the Resource Assignments that are to be made for the Bookings to be created. Look at the Resource Assignment entity table for more details |

**Resource Assignments**

|  Name   | Type  | Required | Description   |
|---------------------|-------------|---|---------|
|RequirementId | 	Guid|	Yes|	The resource requirement ID of the Requirement for which the booking record is to be created. |
|ResourceId  | Guid    | Yes | The bookable resource ID of the Resource for which you want to create the booking. |
| BookingStatusId  | Guid  | Yes | The booking status ID of the booking to be created. |
| Effort | Integer  |  No| The capacity of the Bookable Resource that this booking consumes.|
| TravelTime | Integer  | No| The travel time in minutes.|

### Output 

Returns `HandlerExecuted` that is of Boolean type.

## Using the Requirement Group API

In the following scenario, you schedule a requirement group via API. You need a service created with resources before you can schedule a booking. Follow these steps to create a service activity.

### Service configuration 

![Service configuration.](../media/ur-scheduling-1-new.png "Service configuration")

  1. In the site map, under **Scheduling**, select **Service**.
  2. Go to **Resource Requirements**.
  3. Create a service activity. For this example, we created **Test Requirement Group**.

### Service Activity configuration  

![Service Activity configuration.](../media/ur-scheduling-2-new.png "Service Activity configuration")

  1. In the site map, under **Scheduling**, select **Service Activities**.
  5. Go to **Service Activities**.
  6. For **Subject**, select **Test Requirement Group**.
  7. For **Service**, select **Test Requirement Group**.

> [!NOTE]
> This configuation automatically creates a resource requirement group that has the same name as the service activity. 

Now you have a requirement group automatically created that has one technician (resource) to be scheduled to perform service at your customer's location. 

### Resource Requirement Group grid 

The following image is an example configuration of the Resource Requirement Group page. 

![Active Requirements Group.](../media/ur-scheduling-3-new.png "Active Requirements Group")

> [!NOTE] 
> To access the **Requirement Group** page from the Customer Service Hub app, you need to navigate there via a URL. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the following URL to reach the **Resource Requirements Group** page: `<<YourOrgURL>YourOrgURL>?appid=guid&pagetype=entitylist&etn=msdyn_requirementgroupr`.


![Test Requirements Group.](../media/ur-scheduling-4-new.png "Test Requirements Group")

3. Go to **General**.
4. Name field **Test Requirement Group**.
5. Enter name in **Owner** field.
6. Template field.
7. Template Required, select **No**.

### Search against your organization

In this next scenario, we show how to pass values for a specific requirement group (Entity Reference - GUID), Required Resources<!--what is this?--> to complete work and match the resource to the organizational unit.      

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> - To run the Requirement Group API, you need GUIDs for:
>   - Requirement group
>   - Bookable resources
>   - Organizational unit (which can be retrieved by using the [Web API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/query-metadata-web-api))
> - If the API is called from a client (browser or canvas app) based on JavaScript, you need to have the extended SOAP SDK. The extended SOAP SDK is not an official Microsoft release, but you can is provided in the downloadable sample files for guidance. 
> - We recommend that you test this search in your development or test environments to validate your scenarios and results before running it in your production environment.
> - This API uses the complex object type in the input and output, so it only supports the SOAP endpoint. It doesn't support the OData endpoint. 


To execute this search against your organization, you need to download the [sample files](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/customer-service/service-scheduling/search-resource-availability-create-bookings), and then complete the following steps.   

1. Modify the hard-coded input parameters in the msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.js file to reflect the GUIDs of records in your org. (Example: requirement group, resources, organizational unit).    

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters to reflect record GUIDs.](../media/ur-scheduling-5.PNG)

[Sample Search Requirement Group](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/customer-service/service-scheduling/search-resource-availability-create-bookings)

2. Add the files in the sample folder as web resources in your organization 

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters to add the files in the sample folder.](../media/ur-scheduling-6-new.png)

![Modify the hard-coded input parameters for the sample folder.](../media/ur-scheduling-7-new.PNG)

3. Navigate to the newly added new_msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.htm page. Example: `<<YourOrgURL>>//WebResources/new_msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroupSample.htm`   

![Navigate to the newly added page.](../media/ur-scheduling-8.PNG)

4. Open the browser's developer tools by using the F12 function key. Set breakpoints as needed, and inspect the request/responses in the developer tool's console.  

![Open the browser developer tools.](../media/ur-scheduling-9.PNG)

  There are multiple sets of time slots that are returned with each set, corresponding to a matching available resource that's mapped to the underlying requirement of the requirement group.   

  After the time slot Sets are returned by the API, you can display them on your custom web portal, app, or a Power App (model/canvas).    

5. After you choose a specific time slot set (Set number 1 in this example), update your new_msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.js web resource in your org to pass the resource assignments (Requirement guid, Resource guid) and the Requirement Group, as shown in the following example.    

![Update web resource to pass resource assignments.](../media/ur-scheduling-10-new.PNG)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Find the complete sample code here: [Create Requirement Group](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/tree/master/customer-service/service-scheduling/search-resource-availability-create-bookings).

![Find the sample code.](../media/ur-scheduling-11-new.png)

6. Navigate to the newly added new_ msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.htm page. (Example: `<<YourOrgURL>>//WebResources/new_msdyn_CreateRequirementGroupBookingsSample.htm`) to invoke a call to the Booking API and create the booking.

![Invoke a call to the Booking API.](../media/ur-scheduling-12.png)

7. Open the browser's developer tools by using the F12 function key. Here, the handler executed value is set to true, indicating that the bookings were created successfully.    

![Handler executed value set to True.](../media/ur-scheduling-13.png)

  We can also verify this value by going back into the organization and checking the associated bookings of the Service/Requirement group we created, as shown in the following images.    

![Check the associated bookings.](../media/ur-scheduling-14-new.png)

![Verify bookings were created successfully.](../media/ur-scheduling-15-new.png)

Other possible scenarios that might use these APIs are:   
- Build a custom web app or a Dynamics 365 portal to provide appointment scheduling for users. The app shows available time slots for the service or product being offered by using multiresource requirements (requirement groups).
- Build a Power Apps canvas app to support self-scheduling scenarios for line-of-business apps.    

For more information, refer to the [Additional resources](#bkmk_seealso) section.

## Example scenarios for migrating from the legacy scheduling API to Universal Resource Scheduling

The scenario-based examples in this section add more details about mapping from the legacy API to the new Universal Resource Scheduling API.   

### Scenario 1: Get two resources for each schedule proposal  

*The following screenshot from the legacy API is provided for reference in this scenario.*

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 1.](../media/ur-scheduling-16-new.png "Legacy screenshot for reference for scenario 1")

1. Create one site (**Site1**), one user (**User1**), and one equipment resource (**Facility/Equipment** tab), with the name **Eq1**, with the site set to **Site1**. 

2. Create the business closure and work hours for the user (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM) and the equipment (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service (**Service1**), and then add **required resources** as **Choose 2** from User1, Eq1. Save and close the service.

![Schedule Service Activity screenshot for scenario 1.](../media/ur-scheduling-17-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 1")

4. Go to the homepage and schedule a service activity and then, select **Service1**, and then select **Schedule** > **Find available slots**. 

5. Verify that each proposal returns the two resources in accordance with the criteria you set.  

#### Universal Resource Scheduling API code for scenario 1 

```csharp
void searchRequirementgroup(Microsoft.Pfe.Xrm.OrganizationServiceManager osm)
{ 
var req = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest() 
{ 
RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
};

  req["Version"] = "1"; 
  Entity requirementSpecification = new Entity();

  //Setting from date 

  requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_fromdate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-  
  26T18:30:00.000Z"));

  //Setting to date 

  requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_todate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12- 
  27T18:29:00.000Z"));

  //Requirement group GUID 
  req["RequirementSpecification"] = requirementSpecification; 
  req["RequirementGroup"] = new   
  Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse("XXXXXXXX"));

  //Executing the request and getting response
  var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req); 
  response.ToString(); 
  response.Dump();
} 	 
```

### Scenario 2: Verify that search results are correct for scheduling 

*The following screenshot from the legacy API is provided for reference in this scenario.* 

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 2.](../media/ur-scheduling-18-new.png "Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 2")

1. Create the following sites and users: 
  - Two sites: Micr0s0ftSite1 and Site2
  - Two users: User1 and User2 (Site2)
  - Go to **Settings**> **Service management** tab and create a site(with the name `Site1`), two resources on the **Facility/Equipment** tab (namely, Eq1 and Eq2) and go to setting> Security and create a user(User1). Two equipment resources on the **Facility/Equipment** tab<!--Is this correct for the UI string? --> (Eq1, Eq2), where Eq1 belongs to Site1 and Eq2 belongs to Site2
 
2. Create the business closure and work hours for the user (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM) and the equipment (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service with status **Reserved** and required resources as **Choose 2** from **same site** from User1, User2, Eq1, Eq2. Save and close the service. 

![Service Activity screenshot for scenario 2.](../media/ur-scheduling-19-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 2")

4. Go to the homepage > **Service Activity** > **Schedule**, and then select the service you created in step 3. Select the site as **Site1**, and then click on **Find available time**. 

5. Verify that the search results that are returned are correct for the site selected in the search criteria.

#### Universal Resource Scheduling API code for scenario 2

```csharp

### Scenario 3: Get proposed schedules that occur within the working hours for an equipment resource

![Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 3.](../media/ur-scheduling-20-new.png "Legacy setup screenshot for reference for scenario 3")

1. Create two sites (Site1, Site2), and then create three equipment resources (Eq1, Eq2, Eq3). 

2. Create the business closure and work hours for all equipment (3:00 PM to 6:00 PM). 

3. Create a new service (**Service1**) Choose 1 from (Random) Eq1, Eq2, #q3.

![Service Activity screenshot for scenario 3.](../media/ur-scheduling-21-new.png "Service Activity screenshot for scenario 3")

4. In the **Schedule Service Activity** dialog box, search for proposals for Service1 by adding a required resource as **Eq1** for a specific date range. 

5. Verify that the proposed schedules that are returned occur within the working hours of the equipment for that date.

{
var req = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest() 
{
RequestName = "msdyn_SearchResourceAvailabilityForRequirementGroup"
};
req["Version"] = "1"; 
Entity requirementSpecification = new Entity();

//Setting start date          
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_fromdate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-26T18:30:00.000Z"));
//Setting end date
requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_todate", DateTime.Parse("2019-12-27T18:29:00.000Z"));

//Setting the eq1 as required resource	 	

requirementSpecification.Attributes.Add("msdyn_resourcerequirementid",Guid.Parse("XXXXXX")); 
req["RequirementSpecification"] = requirementSpecification; 

//Setting the requirement group GUID
req["RequirementGroup"] = new EntityReference("msdyn_requirementgroup", Guid.Parse("XXXXX"));

//Executing the request and getting response. 
var response = osm.GetProxy().Execute(req); 
response.ToString(); 
response.Dump(); 
}
