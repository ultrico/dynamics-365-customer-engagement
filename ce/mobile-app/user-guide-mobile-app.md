## Early access features

If you've enabled early access, you'll have a different navigation experience. This section describes the improved experience on form pages, including form tabs and subgrids.

Your administrator has to opt in to early access updates for your environment and then install the updates to get this feature. More information: [Opt in to early access updates](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates)

### Form page with tabs

When you're on a form page with tabs, you can scroll and span horizontally across the screen. When you select a tab, the header is adjusted so you can easily view the next few tabs.

## Sign out

On the site map ![Site map](media/d365_mobile_sitemap_icon.png "Site map"), select **Profile** ![Profile](media/d365_profile_icon.png "Profile"), and then select **Sign out**.

## Reconfigure and clear cache

If you used the mobile app on a phone or tablet temporarily and want to remove all your cached data before giving the device to someone else, you need to reconfigure the app.

Reconfiguring deletes data and metadata for the current organization from the cache; however, don't rely on this as a security measure.

Make sure you use the **Reconfigure** option before you sign out. If you sign in to another organization but you wanted to delete data for the previous organization that you were signed in to, you'll need to sign back in to that organization and use the **Reconfigure** option to delete data and metadata for that organization from the cache.

To reconfigure the app, select the site map ![Site map](media/d365_mobile_sitemap_icon.png "Site map"), select **Profile** ![Profile](media/d365_profile_icon.png "Profile"), and then select **Reconfigure**.
